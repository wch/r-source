		CHANGES IN R VERSION 0.62.3

NEW FEATURES

    o   preserve factor levels and contrast settings in model objects

    o   factor[...,drop=T] reduces level set

    o   added dblepr, intpr

    o   do_modelmatrix(model.c): Set rownames from data argument.

    o   New generic function preplot().

    o	a new R BATCH interface for non-interactive execution.

    o   added `offline' argument to help() for producing hardcopy via
	latex and dvips.

    o   glm.fit.null now calculates AIC and print.glm.null prints it

    o   effects.lm implemented

    o   new class "mlm" for multivariate "lm", predict.mlm to go with it

    o   "Details" section added to .Rd format

    o   R_PRINTCMD and R_PAPERSIZE can now be set via users' environment,
	overriding setting in startup script.

    o   enhanced identify() 

    o   new function print.coefmat() 

    o   added unix() as .Deprecated("system")

    o   date() replacing system.date()

BUG FIXES

    o   substitute would re-substitute after expanding ... 

    o   indexing modified object in some cases

    o   sweep should work again on dataframes

    o   minor changes in aov()

    o	builds should now actually work on systems that do not add 
	underscores to Fortran symbols

    o   biplot[.default]() was redundant in "base" package; now only in "mva".

    o	unix(..) now helps the user to find  system(..) instead.

    o   apropos("[") and methods("[") now both work (even though "[" is not
	a valid regular expression).

    o   row.names<-.default now exists. Converts object to data
        frame and then adds row names

    o	codes() now distinguishes between ordered and unordered factors

    o	codes() had *opposite* semantics of Splus. Now it's the same.

    o   replicating factors now yields factors (again)

    o   print.summary.xxx  functions more consistent, using new function
	print.coefmat().

    o   Changed many `T' to `TRUE'  and  `F' to `FALSE' in the base package.

    o   binary operation on 1x1 matrix lost dimension

    o   fix anova.glm for null model

    o   glm.fit.null: ensure df.residual == df.null for a null model

    o   summary.glm: correlations in saturated cases

    o   stat.anova: use match.arg and labeled switch statement

    o   Major cleanup of glm iteration code

    o   Correct reordering of glm coefficients if pivoting

    o   Rownames on contrast matrices

    o   factor() and [.factor preserves class "ordered"

    o   Code rearrangement in predict.lm (avoid unnecessary computation)
        + let rownames through on predictions

    o   model.matrix.default: Initial code to define model frame
        simplified considerably after defaulting data argument to
        sys.frame(sys.parent()).  This also removes the problem where
        data.frame mangles I(x^2) and similar names, so that the
        "reorder" sanity check at the end fails.

    o	The handling of extra FORTRAN libraries (f2c-related and BLAS)
	should now be correct.  Via SHLIBLDFLAGS, add-ons will also be
	linked against these libraries.

    o   Modified makefiles so configure followed by "make distclean"
        should restore the source tree to its original form.

    o   a leftover "colours <- colors" caused trouble when collating
	sequence changes caused files to go into the "base" file in a 
	different order

		CHANGES IN R VERSION 0.62.2

(The new functions predict.glm, poly, aov, alias, biplot.default and
biplot.princop, update.default and rug all come from Brian D. Ripley,
who is also responsible for finding and/or fixing a lot of the bugs)

NEW FEATURES

    o   predict.glm() added.

    o   text() is generic.

    o   update.default() (replaces update.glm() and update.lm()).
        (This will only work if you comment out update.lm and
	update.glm in the sources, or disable them with
	update.lm<-function(object,...)NextMethod(), etc.)

    o	predict.lm() changed towards S-plus compatibility. Intervals are
	still available via interval= argument.

    o	zapsmall() function.

    o	polygon() now handles NAs

    o	options(show.signif.stars = TRUE).  If FALSE,
	summary.lm and similar functions do *not* print significance stars
	anymore.

    o	poly() for [g]lm modelling.

    o	aov()	for Analysis Of Variance [anova].

    o	alias() for displaying ``aliased'' factor levels in (>=2)way anova.

    o	mva: Now has  biplot and biplot.princomp

    o	rug() plot.

    o	new  src/library/profile/Common.R   for	 OS-independent intialization.

    o   new date stamp mechanism (ensures that prerelease versions carry
        correct date)

BUG FIXES

    o   abbreviate() now always retains the first letter.

    o   attr() partial matches for attribute name.

    o   axis() accepts graphical parameters.

    o   binomial() accepts factor responses.

    o   cbind() works with data frames.

    o   contrasts() gives simpler labels (like S) for factors with
        two levels.

    o   contrasts<-() now has a how.many= argument.

    o   contour() and image() can accept a list to specify the matrix.

    o   contr.poly() uses orthogonal polynomials (like S) not raw
        polynomials.

    o   data() could fail with a partial match to the dataset name.

    o   density() works correctly if from= or to= are used.
            n= can now take any value, not just a large power of 2.

    o   expand.grid() now accepts more than two arguments,
        or a list of factors.

    o   factor() and ordered() handle their levels argument better.

    o   family.glm() now returns the correct family (including link etc).

    o   legend() now knows about lwd.

    o   match.args() works correctly for default arguments.

    o   model.frame.lm() did not invoke `lm'.

    o   model.matrix() calls model.frame() if needed.

    o   model.response() now returns names, so glm() gives names to
        residuals, fitted values, etc.

    o   quasi() works in glm() (was missing aic component).

    o   seq() sometimes omitted the final value due to rounding error.

    o   terms.formula() and update.formula() now resolve `.' in formulae
        and tidy up `(a + b) - b' etc.

    o   ... is now passed down correctly to functions inside functions.

    o   save.image didn't work (Martyn Plummer)

    o   abs() instead of fabs() in seq.c crashed R on Digital Unix

    o   model.matrix() gagged on variables with complicated names

    o   saturated models acting up in glm

    o   various improvement of build procedures

    o   rbind(NULL, matrix) core dump

    o	density() default 'bw' now 0.9*(...) instead of 1.06*(...)
				[=Silverman's rule of thumb].

    o	detach(2) now works.

    o	format() doesn't drop names anymore.

    o	format.pval() works with NAs.

    o	print.[summary.][g]lm() functions print numbers better formatted.

    o	legend() now also works properly in  log coordinates.

    o	backsolve() now working;  bakslv.c not depending on
	Fortran_underscores.

    o	Tick marks acting up on log axes in postscript (fix from Martyn Plummer)

    o	The Rd format has a new section \details{} (needed for proper
	Sd2Rd translation). \R was not understood for nroff
	conversions, longer dashes (-- and --- in latex syntax) are
	now converted properly.

    o	prompt.default() now carries "\details{}".

    o	R [ SHLIB | COMPILE ] were broken on some Solaris systems
	due to use of bash syntax. R [ INSTALL | COMPILE | SHLIB ]
	now use a MAKE environment variable if present.
	R INSTALL only rebuilds man pages if they are not already
	up to date.


		CHANGES IN R VERSION 0.62.1

BUG FIXES

    o	Accidentally shipped R-0.62 without the tests and  etc/Rdoc
	directories.


		CHANGES IN R VERSION 0.62

NEW FEATURES

    o	Many more help(.) pages.

    o	The top level Makefile now supports the usual
	   ./configure; make; make install
	procedure (new make targets `all' and `install').

    o	The HTML help pages can now be searched for keywords.

    o	Conversion of functions to and from lists. formals<- and body<-.
	The alist() function makes it easier to construct argument lists,
	etc. Added expression-->list coercion.

    o	complex(.) now has optional 'argument' and 'modulus' arguments,
	allowing ``polar coordinate'' specifications.

    o	layout() documented and improved: starts default device if needed, and
	returns number of figures.

    o	New find() function [relying on apropos(..)].

    o	objects(<integer>) now works, being equivalent to
	objects(pos=<int.>).

    o	storage.mode() and related functions now return
	"double" instead of "real", for compatibility.
	"real" is still allowed as synomym for "double".

    o	A tests/ directory has been added (in the source), and "make tests"
	has been modified to run more than all the examples from the base
	package.  The exact 'make tests' behavior is still bound to change.

    o	An experimental directory etc/Rdoc has been added with a perl5
	module to parse R documentation files.	Sample perl programs
	to use this module are also included.

    o	All internal mechanisms to support factors and data.frames
	have been removed.  These are now entirely supported by
	interpreted code! `is.unordered' has been eliminated.
	Thanks to John Chambers for allowing the distribution of his
	StatLib code.

    o	"pmatch" is now completely S compatible and is not just another
	name for "charmatch".

    o	There is now a function called ".Alias" which can be used to
	provide multiple names for the same object.  Example:
		lm2 <- .Alias(lm)
	This is dangerous because it can be used to defeat the
	call-by-value illusion.

    o	Many functions changed from <primitive> to .Internal(..).
	Currently, new .Internal(.)s in ..library/base/R/New-Internal.R
	Primitive functions are now printed as ``.Primitive(..)''.

    o	[dpqr]hyper(.) now also work with some 0 arguments.

    o	C-code: Many "-Wall" fixes (MM & DB).

    o	mva's dist() now takes arguments diag and upper which control
	how the distance matrix is printed. plot.hclust() now takes a
	labels argument.

    o	Attributes are now propagated correctly in binary operations.
	Changes from:
	  Steve Oncley and Gordon Maclean
	  National Center for Atmospheric Research
	  Boulder, Colorado USA

    o	configure now also checks for fort77.

    o	Usage of R INSTALL now is
	  R INSTALL [options] [-l lib] pkg_1 ... pkg_n
	The +/- options were replaced by GNU-style `--no-docs' and
	`--no-text', `--no-html', and `--no-latex'.

    o	Usage of R REMOVE now is
	  R REMOVE [options] [-l lib] pkg_1 ... pkg_n

    o	Usage of R COMPILE now is R COMPILE [options] srcfiles, where
	through options one can set e.g. CFLAGS or FFLAGS.

    o	Usage of R SHLIB now is R SHLIB [-o libname] files, where the
	file names can be that of source or object files.

    o	A new R CMD interface allows invokation of executables in
	$RHOME/{etc,cmd} without installing them or setting paths.

    o	Data files are now also documented using the Rd format, all
	data documentation in the base package has been converted
	accordingly. Rd files for data have a \keyword{datasets} as
	identifier.

    o	new function mahalanobis() for Mahalanobis distance

    o	quantile.default() now handles Inf's correctly.

    o	New command line options `--enable-blas' and `--enable-readline'
	to configure.

    o	pretty(x) is more reasonable when max(x)-min(x) < 1e-10 max(|x|),
	and has a new argument "shrink.sml" for that case.

    o	formatC(.) supports a new "fg" format for flexible
	non-exponential formatting.

    o	etc/build-htmlpkglist has been integrated into etc/build-help
	(option --htmllists)

    o	family	gaussian(.) and inverse.gaussian(.) both accept several
	link arguments [J.Lindsey].

    o	The graphics function "tck" now produces effects just
	like those in S (e.g. par(tck=1) now produces grid lines).
	Since using "tck" produces nasty results in some circumstances
	there is also an alternative parameter "tcl" which defines
	the tick length in terms of lines of text.  The default
	setting is par(tcl=-0.5).

    o	menu() now takes additional arguments `graphics' (currently
	unused) and `title'.

    o	New function plot.formula().
	plot.factor() now produces boxplots when given 2 arguments.

    o	New function write.table().

    o	signif() now has a `digits' default of 6.

    o	Old-style long command line options (`-save' etc) changed to
	GNU-style (`--save' etc).
	Debugging options (`-ddd', `-gdb', `-xxgdb') unified into the
	new `--debugger' (`-d').
	New command line options `--version' (`-V') and `--help' (`-h')
	which print useful information and exit.

    o	The loading of profiles at startup now works as follows.
	Unless the new `--no-site-file' was given, a site profile is
	sought (as specified via the environment variable `RPROFILE',
	or if this is unset defaulting to `${RHOME}/etc/Rprofile'.
	Then, unless the new `--no-init-file' was given, the user
	profiles (`.Rprofile' and `~/.Rprofile') are sought.

    o	New functions subset() and transform() intended primarily to
	make life with dataframes easier.

    o	debian directory has been added so Debian GNU/Linux packages can be
	created from raw source.

    o	The graphics system has been through a major overhaul.
	It is now possible to have multiple active device drivers
	and to control them with full suite of dev.xxx() functions
	available in S.	 Display lists are now kept for interactive
	devices.  When an on-screen graphics window is resized,
	the content of that window is redrawn at the new size.
	At present only X11 and PostScript graphics device drivers
	are available, but more are on the way.

    o	On systems using IEEE arithmetic, the builtin Inf and NaN
	values are now recognised and used.  NA and NaN should
	propagate correctly in computations, with NA dominating
	in computations involving both quantities.
	E.g. NA+NaN is NA.

    o	Some of the t, F, and chisq distribution/probability functions
	now allow a noncentrality parameter `ncp'.

    o	Functions ptukey() and qtukey() provide the distribution and
	quantile functions for the maximum of several studentized
	ranges.

    o	system.file()  [now documented] returns all files matched by
	wildcards.

    o	data() now supports more file formats: .RData for binary
	files, .txt or .tab for data to be read by
	`read.table(file, header=TRUE)' and .csv for data to be read
	by `read.table(file, header=TRUE, sep=";")'

    o	Rdconv: new tabular environment, new sections `\format' and
	`\source', new output format `-type Sd' for S documentation

    o	.First.lib() now implemented; called by library() after loading
	a package.

    o	print.summary.[g]lm() now give `significance stars' and a symbolic
	correlation matrix.

    o	new is.R() function.

    o	glm() now also returns an AIC value [from JL].
	print..glm methods indicate the options()$contrasts in some cases.
	In summary.glm(..., correlation=..), the default has been changed to
	corr. = FALSE  which is consistent with	 summary.lm().
	predict() now works again for glm objects.

    o	the `flag' argument in formatC(.) can now have more than one
	character.

    o	nlm() returns the number of iterations used [from J.Lindsey].

    o	cut, diff, hist, mean, quantile, seq, trunc()  are now all generic.
	cut() has an `include.lowest' argument as S.

    o	save.image() as short-cut to save the current session in .RData.

    o	new design of HTML help pages, including an index of all
	functions from all installed packages.

    o	new editor function pico()

    o	matrices and arrays can have zero extents

BUG FIXES (many of which resulted from the added features...)

    o	atanh(.) now works

    o	summary(glm) and summary(lm) now use compatible names.

    o	[pq]tukey(.) now working.

    o	title() now handles main=, sub=, xlab=, ylab= with embedded
	newlines correctly.  This is partly a change in title and
	partly a change in the underlying graphics code.

    o	min(.), max(.), sum(.)	now return integer for integer arguments.

    o	which(.) now returns integer.

    o	Rd files: leading whitespace of lines in user-defined sections
	was not correctly removed by Rdconv

    o	sign(.) works again.

    o	[.data.frame segfaulted if arg. wasn't a data frame

    o	"R --no-readline" now again gives proper prompts.

    o	demos/zero.R  dyn.load(.) now should be working more easily.

    o	mode(.) now returns "(" for a "parentheses 'call'".

    o	Bug fix in mva dist.c for method binary (gave "invalid
	distance"). plot.hclust failed for data without row names.

    o	R INSTALL should work (again) now when `pkg' is a relative file
	name.

    o	.not.yet.implemented() now takes an arbitrary number of args.

    o	Plotting of dendrograms is working again.

    o	data.frame(.) now uses "1:n" as default row.names.

    o	image(.) and contour(.) now also work called as, e.g., ``image(z)''.

    o	the first argument of axis(.) is now called `side' as in S.

    o	format(NULL) now works.

    o	minor fix in symnum.

    o	hist() now is more compatible to S, has a new `labels' argument,
	and should work ok for non-equidistant breaks.

    o	plot(-1) now labels properly.

    o	Many small code changes (eliminating extraneous variables, nested comm.)
	in C code in order to satisfy `gcc -Wall' [Doug Bates].

    o	model.extract() will now extract arbitrary model frame arguments.


    o	list of currently loaded libraries (.Dyn.libs) not saved
	from session to session (really, this time)

    o	rhyper works with vectorisation, degenerate cases.

    o	printing of objects in lists now dispatches methods correctly

		CHANGES IN R VERSION 0.61.2

BUG FIXES

    o	pretty(999) resulted in an infinite loop due to integer overflow.
	pretty(.) now sometimes returns different results than before.

    o	pi:6  returned integer, instead of real.

    o	[.data.frame caused segfault if called with non-dataframe argument

    o	hist() now is more compatible to S, has a new `labels' argument,
	and should work ok for non-equidistant breaks.

    o	lgamma(-1e7) segfaulted.
	gamma(.) and lgamma(.) now give proper results for negative integers.

    o	formatC(pi,dig=20,wid=2) segfaulted.

    o	quantile(..., pr = c(1,2,5)/1000)  gave all names as "0%".

    o	In 0.61.1, model.matrix was fixed to pay attention to the names of
	the names of its data arg, but the data arg was defaulting to an
	unnamed list, so  model.matrix(~x)  failed...

    o	Indexing with [[]] and a zero-length vector segfaulted.

    o	Coercion of factors as in S-plus

    o	dyn.load statement in demos/dynload/zero.R fixed

    o	Factors could get allocated without the OBJECT bit, which
	nearly drove Kurt mad trying to write plot.factor...

    o	Fixed confidence limit problem in t.test

		CHANGES IN R VERSION 0.61.1

NEW FEATURES

    o	None (by definition, x.y.z releases are bugfix releases now)

BUG FIXES

    o	Return statements of the form return(x,y) will now return
	a list with named components.

    o	Parsing of nested "if" statments was broken.  This is fixed now.
	(Reported by Paul Gilbert).

    o	Wrong declaration of ConsoleBufCnt in src/main/scan.c caused crash
	in Irix (George White <gwhite@bodnext.bio.dfo.ca>)

    o	if(nmatch = 0) bug in src/main/character.c fixed (Doug Bates)

    o	R_alloc/S_alloc fixes. The former allocated 4 times more than
	needed, the latter zeroed half of what it got, sizeof() mistakes
	in both cases.

    o	c(ordered factor) caused segfault (uninitalised pointer), now
	fixed.

    o	behaviour of as.numeric() on factors changed recently; now
	documented.

    o	model.matrix() now pays attention to the names on its dataframe
	argument.

    o	Fixes to group methods.

    o	autoload() caused infinite loop if function  wasn't found in
	library on loading

    o	The pager ate the rest of stdin in batch mode, now fixed. Also,
	stdout was not flushed before call to system(). "make tests"
	should work now.

    o	Empty directories now created by configure (so that it doesn't
	matter that "CVS export" doesn't do it)

    o	as.name() made idempotent (i.e. if is.name(x) then as.name(x)==x)

    o	3 problems with glm, 2 in glm.fit and a one in print.glm fixed
	[Jim Lindsey]

    o	binomial (family) now works when 'n=0'. [J.Lindsey]

    o	split() now also works in split(1:10,1:2)

    o	strsplit() now also works for strsplit(c,NULL)

    o	A LANG='..' environment variable no longer affects  scan()ing of
	numbers.

    o	seq(.) doesn't segfault anymore in  gl(2,3):gl(1,6)

    o	contour(.) now also works with integer arguments


		CHANGES IN R VERSION 0.61

We try to make development more flexible by creating a "CVS branch". This
should make it easier to produce patches for obvious bugs in the releases,
without having to wait for changes in other areas to stabilize.

NEW FEATURES

    o	New functions "all.vars" and "all.names" added.

    o	There has been a small change in the include file structure.
	All include files now live in RHOME/src/include and are
	copied to RHOME/include when needed.

    o	The "noquote" functions are now documented.

    o	A new `language' demo, "is.things", is provided.

    o	symnum(.) function

    o	The files in R/library/base/data have had a .R suffix added.

BUG_FIXES

    o	A nasty bug which showed when attempt was made to create
	a zero length call has been fixed.

    o	model.matrix(.) now allows a  contrasts argument.

    o	barplot(.) now also works for barplot(table(rpois(100,3))).

    o	make clean ; make    now should work;  ./Makefile.in eliminated

    o	format(.) is now generic;  the default method has a `digits' argument.


		CHANGES IN R VERSION 0.60.1

NEW FEATURES

    o	"split" is now a generic function, with a method for data frames.
	(contributed by Doug Bates).

    o	S compatible functions "all.names" and "all.vars" added.



BUG FIXES

    o	A file was closed multiple times if an error message occurred
	after sourcing a file.	In some versions of Linux this caused
	a core dump.

    o	The inclusion <readline/history.h> was causing problems with
	some versions of readline because the file did not exist.
	This is now detected by configure.



		CHANGES IN R VERSION 0.60

R is about to become an official part of the GNU project.
To quote RMS (Richard Stallman)

		``I hereby dub R GNU software!''


NEW FEATURES

    o	There has been a major change in directory structure
	masterminded by Kurt Hornik.
	library(.) now attaches ``package''s which are better
	integrated, see "?library".  Packages may be available from outside
	the RHOME path via the .lib.loc variable.

    o	The documentation format (of files in src/library/<package>/man/ )
	has changed to a more easily parsable LaTeX like format.
	The doc files now all end in `.Rd'.
	etc/Rman2Rd  can be used to translate old-style documentation to
	the new one.
	The translation to *roff, LaTeX and HTML is now done using
	etc/Rdconv, written in Perl by Fritz Leisch.

	The HTML online help produced has now links which work.
	The manual (in doc/manual/) now includes a section on the
	documentation format and on mathematical text in graphs.

	etc/ further contains `Sd2Rd' for (partial) translation of S `.d'
	documentation to Rd, and
	`Rd2txt' and `Rd2dvi' for easy previewing of single Rd files.

    o	The use of "names" on one dimensional arrays will now produce
	sensible results.  This means that for most purposes,
	one dimensional arrays can be treated like vectors.

    o	We have a applied a patch from mward@wolf.hip.berkeley.edu
	which should substantially improve the speed of (vector)
	arithmetic.

    o	The modeling formula handler has been expanded so that it
	accepts y ~ 0 + x as a "through the origin" specification.
	models with no parameters are now acceptable.

    o	"cov", "cor" and "var" now produce a matrix result if either
	of their x or y arguments is a matrix.	Dimnames are propagated
	in a sensible fashion.

    o	New chisq.test(.) and prop.test() from Kurt Hornik.

    o	New read.fwf(.) for reading fixed width format (KH).

    o	New str(.) [alternative to summary(.) for programmers] (MM).

    o	New example data sets "esoph", "infert" and "anscombe" (TL),
	"iris3" (KH) and "stackloss" (MM).

    o	source(.) has several new arguments, notably ``echo = FALSE''.
	This is applied in the new function  demo(.) which runs all the
	code in demos/ (but dynload).

    o	strheight(.) is new, accompanying strwidth(.).
	Both now work for mathematical expressions (Paul Murrell).

    o	The LaTeX version of the manual (-> doc/manual/) now has an index.

    o	EVERY *.Rd file in src/library/base/man/ has now at least one \keyword

    o	New package (`library(.)') "stepfun" for step functions, incl.
	empirical distributions.


BUG FIXES

    o	Regular expression matching is now done with system versions
	of the regexp library.	This should fix compilation problems
	on some platforms.

    o	"approx" and "approxfun", have had some minor adjustments.
	which fix the interpretation of the rule= argument.  The
	code for piecewise constant case is now internal C code
	that than interpreted.	This should boost performance in
	this case.

    o	There has been a minor fixup of "model.frame" to ensure that
	subsets, weights, etc are handled properly.

    o	Model fitting of the form

		 lm(y~., data=df)
		glm(y~., data=df)

	will now work.	The RHS of the model will consist of an
	additive model containing all (non-response) variables in the
	given data frame.

    o	The following type of assignment to data frame subsets

		z <- data.frame(x=rnorm(10),y=rnorm(10),z=rnorm(10))
		z[,1:2] <- matrix(1:20,nc=2)

	was producing incorrect results.  The solution was to wrap
	an implicit "as.data.frame" around the RHS.

    o	"[.data.frame" no longer has a default drop=TRUE argument.
	This means that subsetting a data frame with "[" will always
	yield a data frame.

    o	There was a swap of coordinates internally in "mtext" which
	meant that labels were coming out in the wrong place.  Fixed.

    o	Syntax errors in parse(text="...") would cause R to terminate
	with a segmentation violation.	This no longer happens, although
	the result is still not perfect (the parse() returns).
	This will be fixed by a future parse rewrite.

    o	rainbow, topo.colors, etc., now also work with n in {1,2};
	don't return duplicate neighbor colors anymore.

    o	legend has new `text.width' argument and now also works with
	mathematical expressions as text.

    o	hist() now works better, has a `plot = TRUE' argument, and returns
	something useful.

    o	barplot() improved for `names', now returns vector of midpoints.

    o	lm(), lm.fit, lm.wfit (was `lm.w.fit'):	 Made more compatible.
	Dealing with (close to) collinear situations is still not flexible
	enough.

    o	internal postscript() improved (missing lines in boxplot(.)).

    o	Improvement to many (even most ?) documentation (.Rd) files.

    o	Numerous other fixes of minor things ...



		  CHANGES IN R VERSION 0.50

WARNING!!!

 o  A change in the way that "expressions" are implemented means that
    saved data images which contain expressions will probably not
    restore properly.

NEW FEATURES

 o  The installation of documentation has now been streamlined.
    Many manual entries have been revised.

 o  "expressions" are now implemented as a basic type rather than as
    a class of object.	This change was made as move toward compatibility
    with S and also to implement mathematical annotation in graphs.
    For some examples of the latter, see ?text and ?title.

 o  "eigen" can now handle complex and non-symmetric matrices.

 o  Libraries are now attached by loading their code into newly created
    environment frames on the search path rather than in with the general
    system code.  This means that libraries can be unloaded as well as
    loaded.  They can also have .First.lib and .Last.lib functions.
    The variable .Libraries has been replaced by .library() but should not
    be needed much anymore.

 o  There is now an experimental function called "delay" which creates
    a promise to evaluate an expression.  This provides direct access
    to the lazy evaluation mechanism used by R.

 o  >>>>  'make tests'	 allows to test--run all the help() examples.

 o  New functions   matplot / matpoints / matlines.

 o  cut has 2 new arguments. 'right = TRUE' gives intervals closed on the
	right, open to the left (as S); 'right = FALSE' allows to reverse
	this. The code for default label construction has been enhanced,
	and can be controlled by the new argument 'dig.lab'.

 o  legend(.) has 2 new arguments 'cex' (obvious) and 'merge = FALSE'.
	-> ?legend.
 o  deparse  has a 2nd argument allowing for a kind of line width.
 o  There is now print.density (method).

 o  many help(.) pages have been updated with working examples,
	and several new ones have been created.

 o  influence.measures() and lm.influence now allow to get at the usual
    regression diagnostics.

BUG FIXES

 o  The "is.object" function has been with drawn.

 o  A bug which prevented the "pictex" graphics driver from working
    has been fixed.

 o  Regression diagnostics obtained with "lm.influence" now work when
    there are weights.	This means they should work for glms.

 o  There was a problem in parsing files from statements which were
    separated from following statements by ";" (e.g. data(iris); iris).
    This is fixed.

 o  Comments are handled better in functions.  The rule is that they
    are shifted to just before their statements.  Comments after the
    last statement of a function are lost.

 o  It is now possible to perform complicated mutations of expressions.
    For example
	e <- quote(f(x=1,y=2))
	names(e)[[2]] <- "a"
    will change the x= argument tag into a=.  In the past this produced
    odd error messages.

 o  The length function now tries to return a "sensible" value for all
    the built-in types.	 For example, symbols now have length 1.

 o  "update" should now work in both "lm" and "glm" models.

 o  The functions Re, Im, Mod, Arg and Conj will now accept real-valued
    arguments and return the obvious results.

 o  Minor graphics cleanup.

 o  A fix for convergence problems in glm from Thomas Lumley included.

 o  A new version of qt() should not take infinitely long to get an
    answer in the large degrees if freedom case.  The underlying code
    (Hill 1970, CACM) appears to be much faster and more accurate than
    Splus.

 o  A final Newton step has been added to give a final "polish" to
    the quantiles produced by pnorm().	These should be close to full
    accuracy now.

 o  A bug in qbeta found by Martin Maechler has been fixed.  This should
    speed up quantile computation for the F and Beta distributions.
    Further improvements in qbeta(.) by MM.  No infinite loops anymore.

 o  rainbow(.) now allows "start > end" indexing the "color circle".
    topo.colors(n), terrain.colors(n), heat.colors(n) now also work for n=1,2.

 o  ?"+" now works.

 o  tapply has been fixed as indicated by T. Lumley.
