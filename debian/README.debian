r-base for DEBIAN
----------------------

This Debian package was created from the sources on the Comprehensive R Archive
Network sites.  The master site is http://www.ci.tuwien.ac.at/R/contents.html

The executable is called R.

In accordance with the Debian package policy, the executable,
/usr/lib/R/bin/R.binary, has been stripped.  Trying to use the --debugger
option to R may not be as useful as hoped.
