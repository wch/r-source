			    THE R PROJECT LIST

		      Dream, dream, dream ...
				- The Everly Brothers


Here is a list of projects which we think could enhance R substantially.
Some of these we are thinking about doing ourselves, but others could be
taken on by anyone.


 o  3D GRAPHICS
    It would be nice to have something more sophisticated than "persp"
    for plotting surfaces.

 o  DYNAMIC GRAPHICS
    Statistics for the video game generation ...  We need to move to
    an event-based model for this.

 o  GAM MODELS
    The basic code is at STATLIB.

 o  MAPPING
    We have the Becker/Wilks sources for constructing map data bases.
    All we really need is the drawing code.
