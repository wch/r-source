4 Bug-tracking system
*********************

R has a bug-tracking system (or perhaps a bug-filing system is a more
precise description) available on the net at

     `http://bugs.r-project.org/'

and via e-mail to <r-bugs@r-project.org>.  The R function `bug.report()'
can be used to invoke an editor from a within an R session and send the
report to the right address.  It also fills in some basic information, such
as your R version and operating system, which has proved helpful in the
debugging process.

The source distribution has a file `BUGS' at the top level giving a summary
of the entries at the time this distribution was prepared.
