The Makefile.in.in here was originally produced by gettextize, but has
since been modified extensively.

If you convert a C file for use with gettext, add it to POTFILES.in and
then run

	make update-po

to recreate R.pot and update the automated `translations'.

Target

	make update-pkg-po

updates the message catalogs for the C and R code in the standard packages,
uses msgmerge --update to update the translations and then re-makes the 
compiled (.mo) files.


To add a new translation, add the lang.po file to this directory and
add the language to LINGUAS.  Hopefully 'make all R' (in the builddir,
if separate) will do the rest (create ll.gmo and install it as
required).  For fuller manual control, use

	msgfmt -c --statistics -o ll.gmo ll.po

to check and compile the translation, and

	mkdir R_BUILD_DIR/share/locale/ll/LC_MESSAGES
	cp ll.gmo R_BUILD_DIR/share/locale/ll/LC_MESSAGES/R.mo

to install it manually for testing.


Windows RGui translations
=========================

These are contained in RGui.pot, created by running 'make RGui.pot-update'
(called by make update-po).

Translations should be called RGui-ll.po for language 'll'.

To add a translation, add its .gmo file to the RGUI-CATALOGS macro in
Makefile.win, and both the .po and .gmo files to the RGUI-CATALOGS
macro in Makefile.in.in: it will then be automatically distributed and
installed.

To test a translation on Windows, use

	msgfmt -c --statistics -o RGui-ll.gmo RGui-ll.po
	cp RGui-ll.gmo ../share/locale/ll/LC_MESSAGES/RGui.mo

and then startup RGui.exe in an appropriate locale, or setting
LANGUAGE=ll on the command line.
