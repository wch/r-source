=================================================
This is an automated summary of the status of the R-bugs
repository.

Note that this may be neither complete nor perfectly
correct at any given instance: Not all bugs are reported,
and some reported bugs may have been fixed, but the
repository not yet updated.

Some bug fixes are difficult to verify because they pertain
to specific hardware or operating system versions. If you
have information to contribute, please do so.

If you happen to know how to fix a problem please send
patches to the bug repository, too.

New bugs are reported either through the web
interface at r-bugs.r-project.org or via email to
r-bugs@r-project.org. The bug.report() function can be
used to automate parts of the procedure on many systems.
Followups on older bugs can be done by including the string
"(PR#999)" in the Subject of an email (change 999 to the
actual reference number, of course!).

--It might make more sense to use axis rather than mtext, as boxplot does.
* PR# 816 *
Subject: dotplot: character size of labels
From: RINNER Heinrich <H.RINNER@TIROL.GV.AT>
Date: Thu, 18 Jan 2001 14:54:32 +0100
--Suggested fix is incorporated in 1.2.2.
--
--There is a deeper problem:  mtext() ignores par(cex=.5) in general.  
--To see the problem try:  par(cex=.5); mtext("hi")
--Paul thinks the right fix is to change the argument list for mtext so that
--cex=par(cex) by default rather than cex=NA by default (plus corresponding
--internal changes to  do_mtext in plot.c).
--This needs to be done very carefully because (i) the change suggested above 
--mayhave side-effects in many other pieces of interpreted code 
--(ii) do_mtext ignores dd->gp.cexbase unlike, for example, do_plot_xy 
--and anything to do with cexbase needs extreme care.

Subject: screen can't go back to (split) screen with log="y" plot
From: Thomas Vogels <tov@ece.cmu.edu>
Date: 30 Jan 2001 00:39:41 -0500
--Still there. Suggested fix included in followups, but we didn't get around to
--try it in time for 1.2.3.
--
--Fix doesn't work. One problem is that the opar<-par();par(opar) idiom updates
--xaxp before xlog, and the new value of xaxp may only be valid under the new
--value of xlog.
