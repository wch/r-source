/*****************************************************
 These are internal routines and definitions subject
 to unannounced changes. Do not use for packages, etc.
 (The header is not installed.)
 
 There is a great deal of repetition in the definitions 
 of the user-level method definitions and in the internal
 definition structures. This is done to ensure that we
 don't get into troubles needing different types, etc.
 We could do it with typedef's and reduce the code, but it 
 is done now and isn't too complicated yet.
