<h2>Version for <tt>R 1.3.1</tt></h2>
<address>S. M. Iacus</address>
<p>
Changes specific to this version:

<ul> Added the "Config" menu</ul>
<ul> Fixed a bug in the lapack module. Complex functions are now available.</ul>
<ul> Added MPW makefiles to build standard libraries and modules</ul>
<ul> Added experimental script to build R via Apple's MRC compiler</ul>
<ul> Now R needs a new shared library <a href="#f2cLib">"f2cLib"</a> that 
   will increase portability for all fortran based packages</ul>
<ul> Added support for apple events. R begins to be a scriptable
  application. Very limited support by now but will increase soon.
  Some demo scripts have been added.</ul>
<ul> link.html.help() function has been added by picking windows code.</ul>

<p><a NAME="NEWS"></a><b>NEWS</b>
<br>There are several enanchements in this release. Most of them concern
the user interface of R application but one of the most important novelty
is that now
<br>R runs both on MacOS and MacOS X using Carbon technology. This means
that when you run R from MacOS X it run natively under the new System without
calling the Classic Compatibility Module. The use of R under MacOS X takes
lots of advantages starting from the new Aqua look.
<p>As this version is based on the new Carbon technology some new bugs
can appear that we were'nt able to found before releasing R officially.
<p>Any feedback is then welcome at stefano.iacus@unimi.it
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><a NAME="GUI"></a><b>THE NEW GUI</b>
<br>Several menus are now present from this release. The structure of the
menus is as follows with a brief description.

<i><u></u></i>
<p><i><u>About R windows.</u></i>
<br>Normally R opens windows to let 80 character/columns to be displayed.
The size of the windows is calculated on the basis of the size of the font
used.
<br>For non fixed fonts the algorithm can fail so the window can result
a bit larger or smaller then needed.
<br>R windows are opened in cascade for each class (edit windows, file
show windows and graphic windows). This functionality does not work on
MacOS X yet.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><a NAME="EDITOR"></a><b>EXTERNAL EDITOR INTERACTION</b>
<br>From release 7.4.1 of the famous Alpha editor, there is a (tcl) mode
called S+/R.
<br>When you open a file in Apha with the extension ".s"&nbsp; or&nbsp;
".r"&nbsp; this new mode will be installed and you will in the Alpha menu
bar the "S+/R" menu. Of this menu you can use "Process File" or "Process
Selection" to interact with R. By default Alpha sends an “open” command
to R and by default R opens a file in a non editable window (equivalent
to the “File Show” menu). If you want R to source a file you should modify
the .Renviron file accordingly (see below). In particular, the option “OnOpenSource”
is set by default to "FALSE". You should set it to "TRUE". You can change
this when R is still running by <a href="#OPTIONS">simply editing the .Renviron
file</a>. Use "Open File For Editing" from the "File" menu and select the
file ".Renviron". Find the keyword "OnOpenSource" and set it to "TRUE"
(i.e. OnOpneSource=TRUE). The latest version of Alpha can be found at <a href="http://www.alpha.olm.net

">http://www.alpha.olm.net</a><a href="http://www.alpha.olm.net

"></a>
<p><a NAME="MEMORY"></a><b>MEMORY</b>
<br>Under MacOS you should reserve a fixed amount of memory to each application.
As R is just an application, you need to set this to a bigger amount of
memory if for some reason R went out of memory. To do this, go to the Finder
and select the R aplication icon. Then with CMD+I key obtain the Information
for R. Select "Memory" and the fix the amount of memeory you need. Under
MacOS X, there is no need to reserve memory for R. R will used as much
memory as it needs.
<p><a NAME="OPTIONS"></a>
<br><b>SPECIFING OPTIONS: </b>the .Renviron file
<br>In this file you can specify some of the options. This is not standard
for general MacOS/X applications because it currently repleaces the Preferences
one should expect. But, as we have not yet decided which and what number
of preferences items the user can specify, for the time being this is the
only flexible way to take care of user options.
<br>The environment file is used by R application both to simulate the
enviroment on a standard Unix or Windows system and both to set user options.
<br>You can always use "Sys.getenv()" to see which options are enabled/set.
<br>In this file you can specify font names for the R Console and for the
graphic device as well as their sizes. The .Renviron file looks like this:
an option is a "Rkey" with its "keyvalue" that you can specify in new separate
line as follows&nbsp; RKey=keyvalue. Consider that RKey=keyvalue and RKey
= keyvalue are different, that means that blanks/spaces are significant.
"RKey" and "keyvalue" are case sensitive.&nbsp; A symbol "#" at the beginning
of a line means that this is a commented out line.
<br>You can find more details on that in the .Renviron file itself.
<p>Here are the options you can specify:
<p>Lenght of the history size:
<br>---------------------------
<p># The history size
<br># Default: RHISTSIZE=512
<br>RHISTSIZE=512

<p>R behaviour when R application receive a "break" event:
<br>-------------------------------------------------------
<p># R can handle user breaks to
<br># interrupt lengthy calculations
<br># or output. As this code is not
<br># yet optimized, by default R
<br># does not accept user breaks.
<br># If the "Interrupt" switch
<br># is set to TRUE then R intercept
<br># user breaks. With this swtich on
<br># R is a bit slower than with the
<br># switch off
<br># Default: Interrupt=FALSE
<br>&nbsp;
<br> This can be changed at runtime also via the Config menu.
<p>R behaviour when R application receive an "open" event:
<br>-------------------------------------------------------
<p># Wheter to show or source a file
<br># You should set this to TRUE if you
<br># want Alpha&nbsp; be your external editor
<br># Default: OnOpenSource=FALSE
<br>OnOpenSource=FALSE
<p>This means that when you drag a file on top of the R icon or you submit
something from an external editor, R application simply open it (FALSE)
or sources it (TRUE). If the file is a worspace image file, then R loads
that workspace. This can be changed at runtime also via the Config menu.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Tab size of text windows:
<br>-------------------------
<p># The Tab size to use in text windows
<br># range [1,20]
<br># Default: TabSize=5
<br>TabSize=5
<p>Setting the text size of text and R Console windows:
<br>----------------------------------------------------
<p># TextSize to be used in text windows
<br># range [8,14]
<br># Default: TextSize=12
<br>TextSize=12
<p>Macintosh device resolution:
<br>----------------------------
<p># ScreenRes
<br># Useful values is only 72. Possibile other values
<br># are 144, 300, 600 but you should not use them unless
<br># you know exactly what you are doing ! So, please,
<br># don't change this parameter.
<br># Default: ScreenRes=72
<br>ScreenRes=72
<p>Name of the font for the R Console or text windows:
<br>---------------------------------------------------
<p># FontName: this is the font used in text windows.
<br># There are several possibilities for this.
<br># You can specify any font you like but you should
<br># prefere a monospaced font. If the Monaco will be used instead.
<br># Font names are not case sensitive i.e.
<br># FontName=monaco and FontName=MoNacO are the same.
<br># If your font name includes spaces you should provide them
<br># without using quotes, i.e.
<br># FontName=Times New Roman
<br># Default: FontName=monaco
<br>FontName=monaco
<p>Name of the font for the Macintosh graphic device:
<br>--------------------------------------------------
<p># GraphFontName: this font is used for graphic windows.
<br># There are several possibilities for this.
<br># If the font is not usable by R application, then
<br># the font Helvetica will be used instead.
<br># Font names are not case sensitive i.e.
<br># FontName=monaco and FontName=MoNacO are the same.
<br># If your font name includes spaces you should provide them
<br># without including quotes, i.e.
<br># FontName=Times New Roman
<br># Default: GraphFontName=helvetica
<br>GraphFontName=helvetica
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><a NAME="HELPERS"></a><b>R HELPERS</b>
<br>* If you want to use an external editor we suggest you to use Alpha
version&nbsp; 7.4.1 or newer that contains a S+/R mode. Alpha home page
is
<br><a href=" http://www.alpha.olm.net">&nbsp;http://www.alpha.olm.net</a>
<br>* You also need MacZip to use the unzip feature of R. MacZip home page
is
<br>&nbsp;<a href="http://ww.sitec.net/maczip">http://ww.sitec.net/maczip</a>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><a NAME="REQUIREMENTS"></a><b>SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS</b>
<p>To run the R application you need at least 42MB of free memory for the
application itself you work under MacOS but there is no limitations under
MacOS X as virtual memory is always on.
<br>You need the latest version of the 
<a href="http://asu.info.apple.com/swupdates.nsf/artnum/n11916">CarbonLib 
library</a> from Apple. At the time of this release, version 1.2.5 is the current non developer release.
Normally it is included in System 9.1 and X.
<br><a NAME="f2cLib">Now R needs the f2cLib shared library to run. This 
library is distributed with R but in case you miss it you can found it <a 
href="http://www.ci.tuwien.ac.at/~iacus/R">here</a>.
<br>The minimum System version release is 8.6 (+ CarbonLib library).
<br>You no longer need the WasteLib library.
<p><a NAME="FBUGS"></a><b>FIXED BUGS</b>
<br>This version has several bugs fixed. Mostly GUI incongruencies and
problems have been resolved and few R internal numerical bugs. You have
signalled a bug but this has not yet been fixed, please "don't give up" but send
us again your feedback 
(<a href="malito:stefano.iacus@unimi.it">stefano.iacus@unimi.it</a>)
<br>&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
There was an annoying bug concerning the edit menus that on some&nbsp;
(almost random) situations was disabled by R so no cut&amp;paste was&nbsp;
then possible.</li>

<li>
Edit object on non existent R obejct produced a grabbled edit&nbsp; window.</li>

<li>
Herhey fonts where not displayed correctly or at all unless the&nbsp; user
clicked on the graphic window rotated fonts where cutted on top</li>

<li>
Numerical problems with gamma function and polyroot. Now R pass&nbsp; the
tests</li>

<li>
Windows menus produced in some situations some strange</li>

<li>
The graphic device has been completely rewritten now it is&nbsp; faster
and resizing of windows is handled correctly.</li>

<li>
Copying to the clipboard images will non longer produce graphic&nbsp; titles/texts
printed twice.</li>
</ul>

<p><br><a NAME="KBUGS"></a><b>KNOWN BUGS</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
&nbsp;In some situations R stops execution giving an error like this:</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Error in plot.xy(xy.coords(x, y), type = type, pch = pch, col = col, bg
= bg,&nbsp; :
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
negative length vectors are not allowed
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
To solve this problem you just need to resize the device window to a&nbsp;
bigger size
<br>&nbsp;
<ul><li>
On MacOS X&nbsp; copying to the clipboard an image or saving it in a file&nbsp;
produces a picture without text in it. This problem is (probably) due to
the fact that the fonts we use are saved as polygons/vectors and not&nbsp;
as images.</li>
<li>
From version 1.2.2, at startup time you can run scripts by selecting&nbsp;
input and output file and options (this is usefule when you want to run
tests/checks). Both under MacOS and MacOS X you cannot choose a file&nbsp;
that is outside the directory where the R application is. This problem
is not due to the R application but to a bug in Sioux Interface provided&nbsp;
by the compiler. This problem will be fixed with the next release of the
compiler.</li>

<li>For some reason MacZip does not intercat too much with R under MacOS
X.&nbsp; Moreover MacZip has not yet been “carbonized” so when R calls
it to&nbsp; uncompress items it also starts up Classic Environment. We
suggest to&nbsp; uncompress the help and examples files directly by using
Stuffit Expander&nbsp; that is part of the utilities provided with System
X.</li>

<li> This version of R and Adobe ATM are incompatible. We are looking at 
the problem. The solution is that you should switch ATM off before running 
R. (Thanks to R. Gill for feedback on this bug)</li>

<li>Internet functionality is not available yet. We are working on this.</li>

<li>Mathematical expressions are not yet well spaced moreover, 
mathemathic symbols are not rotated.</li>

<td>Under Unix you usually create a directory, go into it and launch R.&nbsp;
Under MacOS you can create a directory and put all the files that you need
there. You then (or before) run R in its own directory and&nbsp; use the
menu item "Tools->Change Working Directory" to change the&nbsp; current
working directory to directory you have created. You can&nbsp; then work
as you do in Unix. You can save/load workspace image to&nbsp; this directory,
as well as the command history files. You can then&nbsp; reload these next
time you work.</td>

<td>&nbsp;You can now use the standard Macintosh control break sequence, 
that is you should press "Cmd option" plus "." (dot). This will interrupt 
any R loops.
</td>
