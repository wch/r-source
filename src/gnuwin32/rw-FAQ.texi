@chapter Introduction


This FAQ is for the Windows port of R: it describes features specific to
that version. The main R FAQ can be found at

@display
@uref{http://www.ci.tuwien.ac.at/~hornik/R/R-FAQ.html}.
@end display

The information here applies only to recent versions of R for Windows,
(@code{rw1020} or later); the current version is often called something like
@code{@value{VERSION}} (although not officially).

@section Where can I find the latest version?

Go to any CRAN site (see @uref{http://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html}
for a list), navigate to the @code{bin/windows/base}
directory and collect the files you need. You will need at least the
files

@example
      rwXxxxb1.zip rwXxxxb2.zip
      rwXxxxh.zip (text help) or rwXxxxch.zip (Compiled HTML help)
@end example
@noindent
and you may want @code{rwXxxxwh.zip} (the Windows help files) or
@code{rwXxxxw.zip} (the HTML format help files), @code{rwXxxxl.zip} (the
LaTeX format help files, used for offline printing), or
@code{rwXxxxd?.zip} (the draft manuals, in PDF).

Optionally, you can download the installer, @code{rwinst.exe}.


@node How do I install R for Windows?, How do I run it?, Where can I find the latest version?, Installation and Usage
@section How do I install R for Windows?

First, you need Windows 95/98/ME/NT4/2000: Windows 3.11+win32s will not
work.  Your file system must allow long file names (as is likely except
perhaps for some network-mounted systems).

The simplest way is to run the installer (double-click on the icon for
@code{rwinst.exe} and navigate its wizard-like pages).  Alternatively,
choose a location and unzip the zip files (with a tool that preserves
long file names and the directory structure: we recommend the INFO-ZIP
project's @code{unzip}). All the files will unpack into a directory
called @code{rwXxxx}, for some @code{Xxxx}.

Choose a working directory for R. Make a shortcut to
@code{rwXxxx\bin\Rgui.exe} on your desktop or somewhere on the Start
menu file tree. Right-click the shortcut, select Properties... and
change the `Start in' field to your working directory.

You may also want to add command-line arguments at the end of the Target
field, for example @code{--max-mem-size=40M}. You can also set
environment variables at the end of the Target field, for example
@code{R_LIBS=e:/R/library}.


@node How do I run it?, There seems to be a limit on the memory it uses!, How do I install R for Windows?, Installation and Usage
@section How do I run it?

Just double-click on the shortcut you prepared at installation.

If you want to set up another project, make a new shortcut or use the
existing one, and change the `Start in' field of the Properties.

@node There seems to be a limit on the memory it uses!, How can I keep workspaces for different projects in different directories?, How do I run it?, Installation and Usage
@section There seems to be a limit on the memory it uses!

Indeed there is.  It is set by the command-line flag
@code{--max-mem-size} and defaults to the smaller of the amount of
physical RAM in the machine and 256Mb.  It can be set to any amount over
10M.  Be aware though that Windows has (in most versions) a maximum
amount of user virtual memory of 2Gb, and parts of this can be reserved
by processes but not used.  R itself reserves 256Mb on startup.  Because
of the way the memory manager works, it is possible that there will be
free memory but R will not be able to reserve it.

Use @code{?Memory} and @code{?memory.size} for information about memory
usage.

R can be compiled to use a different memory manager which may be better
at using large amounts of memory, but is substantially slower (making R
several times slower on some tasks).


@node How can I keep workspaces for different projects in different directories?, How do I print from R?, There seems to be a limit on the memory it uses!, Installation and Usage
@section How can I keep workspaces for different projects in different directories?

Create a separate shortcut for each project: see Q2.3. All the paths to
files used by R are relative to the starting directory, so setting the
`Start in' field automatically helps separate projects.


@node How do I print from R?, Can I use R BATCH?, How can I keep workspaces for different projects in different directories?, Installation and Usage
@section How do I print from R?

It depends what you want to print.

@itemize @bullet
@item You can print the graphics window from its menu or by using
@code{dev.print()}.
@item You can print from the R console or pager by @code{File | Print}.
(This will print the selection if there is one,
otherwise the whole console or pager contents.)
@item You can print help files from the pager or HTML browser.
@item If you have configured @code{RHOME\bin\helpPRINT.bat} and have
latex installed you can print help files by @code{help(fn_name, offline=TRUE)}.
@end itemize

@node Can I use R BATCH?, Can I use rwXxxx with ESS and emacs?, How do I print from R?, Installation and Usage
@section Can I use @code{R BATCH}?

Yes, if you have Perl installed.  The Windows analogue is @code{Rcmd BATCH}:
use @code{Rcmd BATCH --help} for full details.

Otherwise you can set up a batch file using @code{Rterm.exe}. A sample
batch file might contain (as one line)

@example
path_to_R\bin\Rterm.exe --no-restore --no-save < %1 > %1.out
@end example

@node Can I use rwXxxx with ESS and emacs?, What are HOME and working directories?, Can I use R BATCH?, Installation and Usage
@section Can I use rwXxxx with ESS and emacs?

Yes. The latest versions of ESS (e.g. 5.1.18) come with support for this
version of R, and there is support for interrupting the R process from
ESS (by @code{C-c C-c}).

For help with ESS, please send email to @email{ESS-help@@stat.ethz.ch},
not the R mailing lists.


@node What are HOME and working directories?, R can't find my file, Can I use rwXxxx with ESS and emacs?, Installation and Usage
@section What are HOME and working directories?

Several places in the documentation use these terms.

The working directory is the directory from which @code{Rgui} or
@code{Rterm} was launched, unless a shortcut was used when it is given
by the `Start in' field of the shortcut's properties. You can find this
from R code by the call @code{getwd()}.

The home directory is set as follows:@*
If environment variable @code{R_USER} is set, its value is used.@*
Otherwise if environment variable @code{HOME} is set, its value is used.@*
Otherwise if environment variables @code{HOMEDRIVE} and @code{HOMEPATH}
are set, the value is @code{$@{HOMEDRIVE@}$@{HOMEPATH@}}.@*
If all of these fail, the current working directory is used.

You can find this from R code by @code{Sys.getenv("R_USER")}.

@node R can't find my file,  , What are HOME and working directories?, Installation and Usage
@section R can't find my file, but I know it is there!

How did you specify it?  Backslashes have to be doubled in R character
strings, so for example one needs
@code{"d:\\rw1021\\library\\xgobi\\scripts\\xgobi.bat"}.
Make life easier for yourself by using forward slashes as path
separators: they do work under Windows.

Another possible source of grief is spaces in folder names.  We have
tried to make R work on paths with spaces in, but lots of people writing
for Unix do not bother. So it is worth trying the alternative short name
(something like @code{PROGRA~1}; you can get if from the Properties).

@end menu

@node Can I install packages (libraries) in this version?, I don't have permission to write to the rwXxxx/library directory, Packages, Packages
@section Can I install packages (libraries) in this version?

Yes, of course. The easy way is to see if a pre-compiled binary version
of the package is available: look on CRAN at
@code{bin/windows/contrib}. If there is, download the zip
file and unpack it in the @code{rwXxxx\library} directory, using
@code{unzip} or similar, or using the installer @code{rwinst.exe}.
Perhaps even easier is to use the R function @code{install.packages()}:
check out its help page.

If there is not a binary version or that is not up-to-date or you prefer
compiling from source, get @code{rwXxxxsp.zip} from the distribution
(see Q1.1) and unpack it in @code{rwXxxx}.  Then read the
@file{readme.packages}.  You will need to collect and install several
tools to use this.  Once you have done so, installation is easy: just run
@code{Rcmd INSTALL pkgname}. To check the package (run all the examples
on its help pages and in its test suite, if any) use @code{Rcmd check
pkgname}.

@node I don't have permission to write to the rwXxxx/library directory, The packages I installed do not appear in the HTML help system, Can I install packages (libraries) in this version?, Packages
@section I don't have permission to write to the @file{rwXxxx/library} directory.

You can install packages anywhere and use the environment variable
@code{R_LIBS} to point to the library location(s). You can also set the
R variable @code{.lib.loc} in your @file{.Rprofile} or when running R.

Suppose your packages are installed in @code{p:\mylibs}. Then you can EITHER

@example
set the environment variable R_LIBS to p:\mylibs
@end example
@noindent
OR put in the @code{.Rprofile} in the working directory or your home directory

@example
.lib.loc <- c("p:/mylibs", .Library)
@end example
@noindent
OR use a package by, e.g.

@example
library(MASS, lib.loc="p:/mylibs")
@end example

How you set an environment variable is system specific: in Windows 9x
you can set them in autoexec.bat or in an MS-DOS window from which you
launch @code{Rgui} / @code{Rterm}.  Under Windows NT/2000 you can use
the control panel or the properties of `My Computer'.  Under Windows Me
you need to use the System Configuration Utility (under Programs,
Accessories, System Tools on the Start menu).  You can also set them on
the command line, for example in the shortcut you could have

@example
path_to_R\bin\Rgui.exe --vsize=10M R_LIBS=e:/R/library
@end example
@noindent
and you can set variables in a file @file{.Renviron} in the working directory
or your home directory, for example

@example
R_LIBS=e:/R/library
R_VSIZE=10M
R_NSIZE=400k
@end example

The order of precedence is the command line (flags before variables)
then @file{.Renviron} then the inherited environment.


@node The packages I installed do not appear in the HTML help system, My functions are not found by the HTML help search system., I don't have permission to write to the rwXxxx/library directory, Packages
@section The packages I installed do not appear in the HTML help system.

HTML help only works for packages installed in @file{rwXxxx\library}.

To update the HTML help files after you have installed a binary package,
run at the R prompt.

@example
> link.html.help()
@end example

(Using @code{install.packages()} does this for you.  The source-code
installation also does this automatically, and if you have that
installed you can use (preferably)

@example
cd rwXxxx\src\gnuwin32\help
make indices
@end example
@noindent
instead.)


@node My functions are not found by the HTML help search system., Loading a package fails., The packages I installed do not appear in the HTML help system, Packages
@section My functions are not found by the HTML help search system.

The following conditions need to hold for functions in a package you installed.

@itemize @bullet
@item the package is installed in @file{rwXxxx\library}.
@item the package contains a @file{CONTENTS} file in top-level directory.
@item you updated the indices as described in the answer to Q3.3 after
installing the package.
@end itemize
@noindent
If those all hold true, this works for us.

@node Loading a package fails., Package TclTk does not work., My functions are not found by the HTML help search system., Packages
@section Loading a package fails.

Is the package compiled for this version of R?  Many of the packages
need to be compiled for a fairly recent version, and in particular a
substantial minority need to be re-compiled for @code{rw1020}. 

You can tell the version the package was compiled for by looking at the
@code{Built:} line in its @file{DESCRIPTION} file or at the
@code{Version} tab of its DLL (if it has one) in the @file{libs}
directory.  (Right-click on the DLL in Windows Explorer, and select
@code{Properties} or use the @code{DLL.version} function inside R.)
If there is no @code{Built:} line or version tab, the package was
compiled too long ago.


@node Package TclTk does not work., Hyperlinks in Compiled HTML do not work., Loading a package fails., Packages
@section Package TclTk does not work.

For package tcltk to work (try @code{demo(tkdensity)} or @code{demo(tkttest)})
you need to have Tcl installed.  Download @file{tcl832.exe} (or use
@file{tcl831.exe} if you already have it) from @url{dev.scriptics.com}
and install it. (That will put the @file{bin} directory containing the
Tcl and Tk DLLs in your path).  You then need to set the environment variable
@code{TCL_LIBRARY}, to something like @code{c:/Program
Files/Tcl/lib/tcl8.3}.  (The startup code for the package will warn you
if this is unset, and Q3.2 explains how to set them.  NB: do not quote
the path, even if as here it contains spaces.)

@node  Hyperlinks in Compiled HTML do not work.,  , Package TclTk does not work., Packages
@section Hyperlinks in Compiled HTML sometimes do not work.

Unfortunately, hyperlinks in compiled HTML files used from R are being
interpreted relative to the current working directory of the R process,
not relative to the @code{pkg.chm} file.  This was not discovered until
@code{rw1021}, so only files made with that version are working
correctly.  Remake the package under @code{rw1021} or later to cure
this.

If you explore the installed @code{.chm} from Windows Explorer, the
links will work.

@section  What should I expect to behave differently from the Unix version of R?

@itemize @bullet
@item R commands can be interrupted by @key{Esc} in @code{Rgui.exe}
and @key{Ctrl-break} or @key{Ctrl-C} in @code{Rterm.exe}: @key{Ctrl-C}
is used for copying in the GUI version.

@item Command-line editing is always available, but is simpler than the
readline-based editing on Unix. For @code{Rgui.exe}, the menu item `Help |
Console' will give details.

@item Using @code{help.start()} does not automatically send help
requests to the browser: use @code{options(htmlhelp=T)} to turn this on.

@item The HTML help system can only access packages installed in the standard
place.

@item Paths to files (e.g. in @code{source()}) can be specified with
either "/" or "\\".

@item @code{system()} is slightly different: see its help page and that
of @code{shell()}.
@end itemize

@node I hear about some nifty features. Please tell me about them!,  , What should I expect to behave differently from the Unix version of R?, Windows Features
@section I hear about some nifty features: please tell me about them!

You have read the @code{README}? There are file menus on the R console,
pager and graphics windows. You can source and save from those menus,
and copy the graphics to @code{png}, @code{jpeg}, @code{bmp},
@code{postscript} or @code{metafile}. There are right-click menus giving
shortcuts to menu items, and optionally toolbars with buttons giving
shortcuts to frequent operations.

If you resize the R console the @code{options(width=)} is automatically
set to the console width (unless disabled in the configuration file).

The graphics has a history mechanism. As the README says:

@quotation
`The History menu allows the recording of plots. When plots have been
recorded they can be reviewed by @key{PgUp} and @key{PgDn}, saved and
replaced.  Recording can be turned on automatically (the Recording item
on the list) or individual plots can be added (Add or the @key{INS}
key). The whole plot history can be saved to or retrieved from an R
variable in the global environment.

There is only one graphics history shared by all the windows devices.'
@end quotation
@noindent
The R console and graphics windows have configuration files stored in
the @file{RHOME\etc} directory called @file{Rconsole} and @file{Rdevga};
you can keep personal copies in your @file{HOME} directory. They contain
comments which should suffice for you to edit them to your
preferences. For more details see @code{?Rconsole}.
There is a Preferences editor invoked from the @code{Edit} menu which
can be used to edit the file @file{Rconsole}.

We believe this is possible by setting suitable fonts in the Rconsole and

Rdevga, and use them by

@example
par(font=, font.lab=, font.main=, font.sub=)

@section I don't see characters with accents at the R console, for example in ?text.

You need to specify a font in Rconsole (see Q4.2) that supports latin1
encoding. The default, @code{Courier New}, does on our systems, as does
@code{FixedSys}.  This may be a problem in other locales, especially for
non-Western European languages.

@node The output to the console seems to be delayed, Long lines seem to be truncated., I don't see characters with accents at the R console, The R Console and Fonts
@section When using Rgui the output to the console seems to be delayed.

This is deliberate: the console output is buffered and re-written in
chunks to be less distracting. You can turn buffering off or on from
the Misc menu or the right-click menu: @key{Ctrl-W} toggles the setting.

If you are sourcing R code or writing from a function, there is another
option. A call to the R function @code{flush.console()} will write out
the buffer and so update the console.


@node Long lines seem to be truncated.,  , The output to the console seems to be delayed, The R Console and Fonts

@node How can I compile R from source?, How do I debug code that I have compiled and dyn.load-ed?, Building from Source, Building from Source
@section How can I compile R from source?

Get the R sources. Suppose you want to compile R-@value{RVERSION}.

@example
tar zxvf R-@value{RVERSION}.tgz
cd R-@value{RVERSION}
cd src\gnuwin32
@end example
@noindent
Now read the @file{INSTALL} file and set up all the tools needed. Then you
can just use @code{make}, sit back and wait. (A complete build takes about
15 minutes on a 300MHz PII with a fast local disc.)

You may need to compile under a case-honouring file system: we found
that a @code{samba}-mounted file system (which maps all file names to lower
case) did not work.


@node How do I debug code that I have compiled and dyn.load-ed?, How do I include C++ code?, How can I compile R from source?, Building from Source
@section How do I debug code that I have compiled and dyn.load-ed?

First, build a version of the R system with debugging information by

@example
make clean
make DEBUG=T
@end example
@noindent

and make a debug version of your package by

@example
make pkgclean-mypkg
make DEBUG=T pkg-mypkg
@end example
@noindent

Then you can debug by

@example
gdb /path/to/rwXxxx/bin/Rgui.exe
@end example
@noindent

However, note

@itemize @bullet
@item gdb will only be able to find the source code if we run in the
location where the source was compiled (@code{rwXxxx/src/gnuwin32} for
the main system, @code{rwXxxx/src/library/mypkg/src} for a package),
unless told otherwise by the @code{directory} command. It is most
convenient to set a list of code locations via @code{directory}
commands in the file @file{.gdbinit} in the directory from which
@code{gdb} is run.

@item It is only possible to set breakpoints in a DLL after the DLL has
been loaded. So a way to examine the function @code{tukeyline} in
package @code{eda} might be

@example
     gdb ../../../../bin/Rgui.exe
     (gdb) break WinMain
     (gdb) run
     [ stops with R.dll loaded ]
     (gdb) break R_ReadConsole
     (gdb) continue
     [ stops with console running ]
     (gdb) continue
     Rconsole> library(eda)
     (gdb) break tukeyline
     (gdb) clear R_ReadConsole
     (gdb) continue
@end example

Fortran symbols need an underline appended.

@item Windows has little support for signals, so the usual idea of running a
program under a debugger and sending it a signal to interrupt it and
drop control back to the debugger does not work with @code{mingw32}
version of @code{gdb}.  It does often work with the @code{cygwin} version.

@item We have seen examples in debugging problems with Windows events that
the @code{cygwin gdb} was able to catch but which terminated the
@code{mingw32 gdb}.
@end itemize

If you have an X server available on the PC, there is a version of
@code{DDD} available that runs under the cygwin emulation layer (follow
the links at @uref{http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin}) and provides a
graphical user interface to @code{gdb}.  Another (Windows-native) GUI
for @code{gdb} is @code{Insight}, part of the latest @code{cygwin}
version of @code{gdb}



@node  How do I include C++ code?, The output from my C code disappears., How do I debug code that I have compiled and dyn.load-ed?, Building from Source
@section  How do I include C++ code?

You need to do two things:

(a) Write a wrapper to export the symbols you want to call from R as
 @code{extern "C"}.

(b) Include the C++ libraries in the link to make the DLL. Suppose
@file{X.cc} contains your C++ code, and @file{X_main.cc} is the wrapper,
as in the example in `@emph{Writing R Extensions}'. Then build the DLL by
(@code{gcc})

@example
...\bin\Rcmd SHLIB X.cc X_main.cc

Construction of static variables will occur when the DLL is loaded, and
destruction when the DLL is unloaded, usually when R terminates.

Note that you will not see the messages from this example in the GUI
console: see the next section.

This example is in package @code{cxx_0.0-0.tar.gz} in the
@file{src/contrib/Devel} section on CRAN, and that can be compiled as
package in the usual way on Windows.

@section  The output from my C code disappears. Why?

The @code{Rgui.exe} console is a Windows application: writing to
@code{stdout} or @code{stderr} will not produce output in the
console. (This will work with @code{Rterm.exe}.)  Use @code{Rprintf} or
@code{REprintf} instead. These are declared in header file
@file{R_ext/PrtUtil.h}.

Note that output from the console is delayed (@pxref{The output to the
console seems to be delayed}), so that you will not normally see any
output before returning to the R prompt.

@section  The output from my Fortran code disappears. Why?

Writing to Fortran output writes to a file, not the @code{Rgui} console.
Use one of the subroutines @code{dblepr}, @code{intpr} or @code{realpr}
documented in the @emph{`Writing R Extensions'} manual.

The console, pagers and graphics window all run in the same thread
as the R engine.  To allow the console etc to respond to Windows events,
call @code{R_ProcessEvents()} periodically from your compiled code.
If you want output to be updated on the console, call
@code{R_FlushConsole()} and then @code{R_ProcessEvents()}.
