Usage: R CMD $name [options] pkgs

Remove the add-on packages specified by pkgs.  The library tree to
remove from can be specified via '--library'.  By default, packages are
removed from the library tree rooted at the first directory given in the
environment variable R_LIBS if this is set, and from the
default R library tree ($R_HOME/library) otherwise.

Options:
  -h, --help		print short help message and exit
  -v, --version		print REMOVE version info and exit
  -l, --library=LIB	remove packages from library tree LIB
