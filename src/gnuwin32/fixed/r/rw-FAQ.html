<h1>1 Introduction</h1>

<p>This FAQ is for the Windows port of R: it describes features
specific to that version. The main R FAQ can be found at</p>

<pre>
<a href=
"http://www.ci.tuwien.ac.at/~hornik/R/R-FAQ.html">http://www.ci.tuwien.ac.at/~hornik/R/R-FAQ.html</a>.
</pre>

<p>The information here applies only to recent versions of R for
Windows, (<code>rw1020</code> or later); the current version is
often called something like <code>rw1023</code> (although not
officially).</p>

<hr>
<a name="Installation%20and%20Usage"></a> 

<h1>2 Installation and Usage</h1>

<a name="Where%20can%20I%20find%20the%20latest%20version%3f"></a> 

<h2>2.1 Where can I find the latest version?</h2>

<p>Go to any CRAN site (see <a href=
"http://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html">
http://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html</a> for a list), navigate to
the <code>bin/windows/base</code> directory and collect the files
you need. You will need at least the files</p>

<pre>
      rw1023b1.zip rw1023b2.zip
      rw1023h.zip (text help) or rw1023ch.zip (Compiled HTML help)
</pre>

<p>and you may want <code>rw1023wh.zip</code> (the Windows help
files) or <code>rw1023w.zip</code> (the HTML format help files),
<code>rw1023l.zip</code> (the LaTeX format help files, used for
offline printing), or <code>rw1023d?.zip</code> (the draft manuals,
in PDF).</p>

<p>Optionally, you can download the installer, <code>
rwinst.exe</code>.</p>

<p>Alternatively, two installers based on Inno Setup are available.
One, <code>SetupR.exe</code>, is about 10Mb and gives a complete
installation. The other, <code>miniR.exe</code>, is a small
installation and comes in five files which fit onto four floppy
discs. <a name="How%20do%20I%20install%20R%20for%20Windows%3f">
</a></p>

<h2>2.2 How do I install R for Windows?</h2>

<p>First, you need Windows 95/98/ME/NT4/2000: Windows 3.11+win32s
will not work. Your file system must allow long file names (as is
likely except perhaps for some network-mounted systems).</p>

<p>The simplest way is to use <code>SetupR.exe</code> or <code>
miniR.exe</code>. Just double-click on the icon and follow the
instructions. If you installed R this way you can uninstall it from
the Control Panel or Start Menu (unless you supressed making a
group for R).</p>

<p>The next-simplest way is to run the installer (double-click on
the icon for <code>rwinst.exe</code> and navigate its wizard-like
pages). Alternatively, choose a location and unzip the zip files
(with a tool that preserves long file names and the directory
structure: we recommend the INFO-ZIP project's <code>unzip</code>).
All the files will unpack into a directory <code>rw1023</code>.</p>

<p>Choose a working directory for R. Unless you used <code>
SetupR.exe</code> or <code>miniR.exe</code> (which did this for
you), make a shortcut to <code>rw1023\bin\Rgui.exe</code> on your
desktop or somewhere on the Start menu file tree. Right-click the
shortcut, select Properties... and change the `Start in' field to
your working directory.</p>

<p>You may also want to add command-line arguments at the end of
the Target field, for example <code>--sdi
--max-mem-size=40M</code>. You can also set environment variables
at the end of the Target field, for example <code>
R_LIBS=e:/R/library</code>. <a name="How%20do%20I%20run%20it%3f">
</a></p>

<h2>2.3 How do I run it?</h2>

<p>Just double-click on the shortcut you prepared at
installation.</p>

<p>If you want to set up another project, make a new shortcut or
use the existing one, and change the `Start in' field of the
Properties. <a name=
"There%20seems%20to%20be%20a%20limit%20on%20the%20memory%20it%20uses!">
</a></p>

<h2>2.4 There seems to be a limit on the memory it uses!</h2>

<p>Indeed there is. It is set by the command-line flag <code>
--max-mem-size</code> and defaults to the smaller of the amount of
physical RAM in the machine and 256Mb. It can be set to any amount
over 10M. Be aware though that Windows has (in most versions) a
maximum amount of user virtual memory of 2Gb, and parts of this can
be reserved by processes but not used. R itself reserves 256Mb on
startup. Because of the way the memory manager works, it is
possible that there will be free memory but R will not be able to
reserve it.</p>

<p>Use <code>?Memory</code> and <code>?memory.size</code> for
information about memory usage.</p>

<p>R can be compiled to use a different memory manager which may be
better at using large amounts of memory, but is substantially
slower (making R several times slower on some tasks). <a name=
"How%20can%20I%20keep%20workspaces%20for%20different%20projects%20in%20different%20directories%3f">
</a></p>

<h2>2.5 How can I keep workspaces for different projects in
different directories?</h2>

<p>Create a separate shortcut for each project: see Q2.3. All the
paths to files used by R are relative to the starting directory, so
setting the `Start in' field automatically helps separate projects.
<a name="How%20do%20I%20print%20from%20R%3f"></a></p>

<h2>2.6 How do I print from R?</h2>

<p>It depends what you want to print.</p>

<ul>
<li>You can print the graphics window from its menu or by using
<code>dev.print()</code>.</li>

<li>You can print from the R console or pager by <code>File |
Print</code>. (This will print the selection if there is one,
otherwise the whole console or pager contents.)</li>

<li>You can print help files from the pager or HTML browser.</li>

<li>If you have configured <code>RHOME\bin\helpPRINT.bat</code> and
have latex installed you can print help files by <code>
help(fn_name, offline=TRUE)</code>.</li>
</ul>

<a name="Can%20I%20use%20R%20BATCH%3f"></a> 

<h2>2.7 Can I use <code>R BATCH</code>?</h2>

<p>Yes, if you have Perl and the files for making source packages
(from <code>rw1023sp.zip</code>) installed. The Windows analogue is
<code>Rcmd BATCH</code>: use <code>Rcmd BATCH --help</code> for
full details.</p>

<p>Otherwise you can set up a batch file using <code>
Rterm.exe</code>. A sample batch file might contain (as one
line)</p>

<pre>
path_to_R\bin\Rterm.exe --no-restore --no-save &lt; %1 &gt; %1.out
</pre>

<a name="Can%20I%20use%20rw1023%20with%20ESS%20and%20emacs%3f"></a>


<h2>2.8 Can I use rw1023 with ESS and emacs?</h2>

<p>Yes. The latest versions of ESS (e.g. 5.1.18) come with support
for this version of R, and there is support for interrupting the R
process from ESS (by <code>C-c C-c</code>).</p>

<p>For help with ESS, please send email to <a href=
"mailto:ESS-help@stat.ethz.ch">ESS-help@stat.ethz.ch</a>, not the R
mailing lists. <a name=
"What%20are%20HOME%20and%20working%20directories%3f"></a></p>

<h2>2.9 What are HOME and working directories?</h2>

<p>Several places in the documentation use these terms.</p>

<p>The working directory is the directory from which <code>
Rgui</code> or <code>Rterm</code> was launched, unless a shortcut
was used when it is given by the `Start in' field of the shortcut's
properties. You can find this from R code by the call <code>
getwd()</code>.</p>

<p>The home directory is set as follows:<br>
If environment variable <code>R_USER</code> is set, its value is
used.<br>
Otherwise if environment variable <code>HOME</code> is set, its
value is used.<br>
Otherwise if environment variables <code>HOMEDRIVE</code> and
<code>HOMEPATH</code> are set, the value is <code>
${HOMEDRIVE}${HOMEPATH}</code>.<br>
If all of these fail, the current working directory is used.</p>

<p>You can find this from R code by <code>
Sys.getenv("R_USER")</code>. <a name=
"R%20can't%20find%20my%20file"></a></p>

<h2>2.10 R can't find my file, but I know it is there!</h2>

<p>How did you specify it? Backslashes have to be doubled in R
character strings, so for example one needs <code>
"d:\\rw1021\\library\\xgobi\\scripts\\xgobi.bat"</code>. Make life
easier for yourself by using forward slashes as path separators:
they do work under Windows.</p>

<p>Another possible source of grief is spaces in folder names. We
have tried to make R work on paths with spaces in, but lots of
people writing packages for Unix do not bother. So it is worth
trying the alternative short name (something like <code>
PROGRA~1</code>; you can get it as the `MS-DOS name' from the
Properties on most versions of Windows). <a name=
"Does%20R%20use%20the%20Registry%3f"></a></p>

<h2>2.11 Does R use the Registry?</h2>

<p>Not itself. The Inno Setup-based installers set some entries to
allow uninstallation. In addition those installers and (by default,
but it can be unchecked) <code>rwinst.exe</code> set a Registry key
<code>LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\R-core\R</code> giving the version and
install path. Again, this is not used by R itself, but it will be
used by the DCOM interface (<a href=
"http://cran.r-project.org/other-software.html">http://cran.r-project.org/other-software.html</a>).</p>

<p>You can add the Registry entries by running <code>
RSetReg.exe</code> in the <code>bin</code> folder, and remove them
by running this with argument <code>/U</code>. Note that the
settings are all per machine and not per user.</p>

<a name="Packages"></a> 

<h1>3 Packages</h1>

<a name=
"Can%20I%20install%20packages%20(libraries)%20in%20this%20version%3f">
</a> 

<h2>3.1 Can I install packages (libraries) in this version?</h2>

<p>Yes, but you will need a lot of tools to do so, unless the
author or the maintainers of the <code>bin/windows/contrib</code>
section on CRAN has been kind enough to provide a pre-compiled
version for Windows as a <code>.zip</code> file.</p>

<p>You can install pre-compiled packages either from CRAN or from a
local <code>.zip</code> file by using <code>
install.packages</code>: see its help page.</p>

<p>Note that the pre-compiled versions on CRAN are unsupported: see
&lt;<code>http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/contrib/ReadMe</code>&gt;</p>

<p>If there is not a pre-compiled version or that is not up-to-date
or you prefer compiling from source, get <code>rw1023.zip</code>
from the distribution (see Q1.1) and unpack it in <code>
rw1023</code>. Then read the <code>readme.packages</code>. You will
need to collect and install several tools to use this. Once you
have done so, just run <code>Rcmd INSTALL pkgname</code>. To check
the package (run all the examples on its help pages and in its test
suite, if any) use <code>Rcmd check pkgname</code>: see the
`Writing R Extensions' manual. <a name=
"I%20don't%20have%20permission%20to%20write%20to%20the%20rw1023%5clibrary%20directory">
</a></p>

<h2>3.2 I don't have permission to write to the <code>
rw1023\library</code> directory.</h2>

<p>You can install packages anywhere and use the environment
variable <code>R_LIBS</code> to point to the library location(s).
You can also set the R variable <code>.lib.loc</code> in your
<code>.Rprofile</code> or when running R.</p>

<p>Suppose your packages are installed in <code>p:\mylibs</code>.
Then you can EITHER</p>

<pre>
set the environment variable R_LIBS to p:\mylibs
</pre>

<p>OR put in the <code>.Rprofile</code> in the working directory or
your home directory</p>

<pre>
.lib.loc &lt;- c("p:/mylibs", .Library)
</pre>

<p>OR use a package by, e.g.</p>

<pre>
library(MASS, lib.loc="p:/mylibs")
</pre>

<p>How you set an environment variable is system specific: in
Windows 9x you can set them in autoexec.bat or in an MS-DOS window
from which you launch <code>Rgui</code> / <code>Rterm</code>. Under
Windows NT/2000 you can use the control panel or the properties of
`My Computer'. Under Windows Me you need to use the System
Configuration Utility (under Programs, Accessories, System Tools on
the Start menu). You can also set them on the command line, for
example in the shortcut you could have</p>

<pre>
path_to_R\bin\Rgui.exe R_LIBS=e:/R/library
</pre>

<p>and you can set variables in a file <code>.Renviron</code> in
the working directory or your home directory, for example</p>

<pre>
R_LIBS=e:/R/library
</pre>

<p>The order of precedence is the command line then <code>
.Renviron</code> then the inherited environment. <a name=
"The%20packages%20I%20installed%20do%20not%20appear%20in%20the%20HTML%20help%20system">
</a></p>

<h2>3.3 The packages I installed do not appear in the HTML help
system.</h2>

<p>HTML help only works for packages installed in <code>
rw1023\library</code>.</p>

<p>To update the HTML help files after you have installed a
pre-compiled package, run at the R prompt.</p>

<pre>
&gt; link.html.help()
</pre>

<a name=
"My%20functions%20are%20not%20found%20by%20the%20HTML%20help%20search%20system.">
</a> 

<h2>3.4 My functions are not found by the HTML help search
system.</h2>

<p>The following conditions need to hold for functions in a package
you installed.</p>

<ul>
<li>the package is installed in <code>rw1023\library</code>.</li>

<li>the package contains a <code>CONTENTS</code> file in its
top-level directory.</li>

<li>you updated the indices as described in the answer to Q3.3
after installing the package.</li>
</ul>

<p>If those all hold true, this works for us. <a name=
"Loading%20a%20package%20fails."></a></p>

<h2>3.5 Loading a package fails.</h2>

<p>Is the package compiled for this version of R? Many of the
packages need to be compiled for a fairly recent version, and in
particular a substantial minority need to be re-compiled for <code>
rw1020</code> and later.</p>

<p>You can tell the version the package was compiled for by looking
at the <code>Built:</code> line in its <code>DESCRIPTION</code>
file or at the <code>Version</code> tab of its DLL (if it has one)
in the <code>libs</code> directory. (Right-click on the DLL in
Windows Explorer, and select <code>Properties</code> or use the
<code>DLL.version</code> function inside R.) If there is no <code>
Built:</code> line or version tab, the package was compiled too
long ago. <a name="Package%20TclTk%20does%20not%20work."></a></p>

<h2>3.6 Package TclTk does not work.</h2>

<p>For package <code>tcltk</code> to work (try <code>
demo(tkdensity)</code> or <code>demo(tkttest)</code>) you need to
have Tcl installed. Download <code>tcl832.exe</code> (or use <code>
tcl831.exe</code> if you already have it) from
&lt;<code>dev.scriptics.com</code>&gt; and install it. (That will
put the <code>bin</code> directory containing the Tcl and Tk DLLs
in your path). You then need to set the environment variable <code>
TCL_LIBRARY</code>, to something like <code>c:/Program
Files/Tcl/lib/tcl8.3</code>. (The startup code for the package will
warn you if this is unset, and Q3.2 explains how to set them. NB:
do not quote the path, even if as here it contains spaces.) <a
name="Hyperlinks%20in%20Compiled%20HTML%20do%20not%20work.">
</a></p>

<h2>3.7 Hyperlinks in Compiled HTML sometimes do not work.</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, hyperlinks in compiled HTML files used from R are
interpreted relative to the current working directory of the R
process, not relative to the <code>pkg.chm</code> file. This was
not discovered until <code>rw1021</code>, so only files made since
that version are working correctly. Remake the package under <code>
rw1021</code> or later to cure this.</p>

</a> 

<h2>4.1 What should I expect to behave differently from the Unix
version of R?</h2>

<ul>
<li>R commands can be interrupted by &lt;Esc&gt; in <code>
Rgui.exe</code> and &lt;Ctrl-break&gt; or &lt;Ctrl-C&gt; in <code>
Rterm.exe</code>: &lt;Ctrl-C&gt; is used for copying in the GUI
version.</li>

<li>Command-line editing is always available, but is simpler than
the readline-based editing on Unix. For <code>Rgui.exe</code>, the
menu item `Help | Console' will give details.</li>

<li>Using <code>help.start()</code> does not automatically send
help requests to the browser: use <code>options(htmlhelp=T)</code>
to turn this on.</li>

</a> 

<h2>4.2 I hear about some nifty features: please tell me about
them!</h2>

<p>You have read the <code>README</code>? There are file menus on
the R console, pager and graphics windows. You can source and save
from those menus, and copy the graphics to <code>png</code>, <code>
jpeg</code>, <code>bmp</code>, <code>postscript</code> or <code>
metafile</code>. There are right-click menus giving shortcuts to
menu items, and optionally toolbars with buttons giving shortcuts
to frequent operations.</p>

<p>If you resize the R console the <code>options(width=)</code> is
automatically set to the console width (unless disabled in the
configuration file).</p>

<p>The graphics has a history mechanism. As the README says:</p>

<blockquote>`The History menu allows the recording of plots. When
plots have been recorded they can be reviewed by &lt;PgUp&gt; and
&lt;PgDn&gt;, saved and replaced. Recording can be turned on
automatically (the Recording item on the list) or individual plots
can be added (Add or the &lt;INS&gt; key). The whole plot history
can be saved to or retrieved from an R variable in the global
environment. 

<p>There is only one graphics history shared by all the windows
devices.'</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The R console and graphics windows have configuration files
stored in the <code>RHOME\etc</code> directory called <code>
Rconsole</code> and <code>Rdevga</code>; you can keep personal
copies in your <code>HOME</code> directory. They contain comments
which should suffice for you to edit them to your preferences. For
more details see <code>?Rconsole</code>. There is a Preferences
editor invoked from the <code>Edit</code> menu which can be used to
edit the file <code>Rconsole</code>. <a name=
"Circles%20appear%20as%20ovals%20on%20screen"></a></p>

<h2>4.3 Circles appear as ovals on screen</h2>

<p>The graphics system asks Windows for the number of pixels per
inch in the X and Y directions, and uses that to size graphics
(which in R are in units of inches). Sometimes the answer is a
complete invention, and in any case Windows will not know exactly
how the horizontal and vertical size have been set on a CRT. You
can specify correct values either in the call to <code>
windows</code> or as options: see <code>?windows</code>. (Typically
these are of the order of 80.)</p>

<p>On one of our systems, the screen height is reported as 240mm,
and the width as 300mm in 1280 x 1024 mode and 320mm in 1280 x 960
and 1600 x 1200 modes. In fact it is a 21" monitor and 400mm x
300mm!</p>

<h2>5.2 How do I store my workspace in a different place?</h2>

<p>Use the `File | Change Dir' menu item to select a new working
directory: this defaults to the last directory you loaded a file
from. The workspace is saved in the working directory. You can also
save a snapshot of the workspace from the `Save Workspace' menu
item. <a name=

<p>Yes. The converse (saving on Windows, loading on Unix) also
works on almost all Unix systems, and workspaces can be
interchanged with the Macintosh port too.</p>

<h1>6 The R Console and Fonts</h1>

<a name=
"I%20would%20like%20to%20be%20able%20to%20use%20Japanese%20fonts"></a>


<h2>6.1 I would like to be able to use Japanese fonts</h2>

<p>for example, in the console and to annotate graphs.</p>

<p>We believe this is possible by setting suitable fonts in the
Rconsole and Rdevga configuration files (see Q4.2). You can specify
additional fonts in Rdevga, and use them by</p>

<pre>
par(font=, font.lab=, font.main=, font.sub=)
</pre>

<p>Nineteen fonts are specified (as 1 to 19) by default: you can
add to these (up to 13 more) or replace them. <a name=
"I%20don't%20see%20characters%20with%20accents%20at%20the%20R%20console">
</a></p>

<h2>6.2 I don't see characters with accents at the R console, for
example in ?text.</h2>

<p>You need to specify a font in Rconsole (see Q4.2) that supports
latin1 encoding. The default, <code>Courier New</code>, does on our
systems, as does <code>FixedSys</code>. This may be a problem in
other locales, especially for non-Western European languages. <a
name=
"The%20output%20to%20the%20console%20seems%20to%20be%20delayed">
</a></p>

<h2>6.3 When using Rgui the output to the console seems to be
delayed.</h2>

<p>This is deliberate: the console output is buffered and
re-written in chunks to be less distracting. You can turn buffering
off or on from the Misc menu or the right-click menu:
&lt;Ctrl-W&gt; toggles the setting.</p>

<p>If you are sourcing R code or writing from a function, there is
another option. A call to the R function <code>
flush.console()</code> will write out the buffer and so update the
console. <a name="Long%20lines%20seem%20to%20be%20truncated.">
</a></p>

<h2>6.4 Long lines in the console or pager are truncated.</h2>

<p>They only <strong>seem</strong> to be truncated: that $ at the
end indicates you can scroll the window to see the rest of the
message. Use the horizontal scrollbar or the &lt;CTRL+arrow&gt;
keys to scroll horizontally.</p>

<h1>7 Building from Source</h1>

<a name="How%20can%20I%20compile%20R%20from%20source%3f"></a> 

<h2>7.1 How can I compile R from source?</h2>

<p>Get the R sources. Suppose you want to compile R-1.2.2.</p>

<pre>
tar zxvf R-1.2.2.tgz
cd R-1.2.2
cd src\gnuwin32
</pre>

<p>Now read the <code>INSTALL</code> file and set up all the tools
needed. Then you can just use <code>make</code>, sit back and wait.
(A complete build takes about 15 minutes on a 300MHz PII with a
fast local disc.)</p>

<p>You may need to compile under a case-honouring file system: we
found that a <code>samba</code>-mounted file system (which maps all
file names to lower case) did not work. <a name=
"How%20do%20I%20include%20compiled%20C%20code%3f"></a></p>

<h2>7.2 How do I include compiled C code?</h2>

<p>We strongly encourage you to do this <em>via</em> building an R
package: see the <em>Writing R Extensions</em> manual. In any event
you should install the parts of the R system for building R
packages in <code>rw1023sp.zip</code>, and get and install the
tools (including Perl) and compilers mentioned in the file <code>
readme.packages</code> there. Then you can use</p>

<pre>
...\bin\Rcmd SHLIB foo.c bar.c
</pre>

<p>to make <code>foo.dll</code>. Use <code>...\bin\Rcmd SHLIB
--help</code> for further options, or see <code>?SHLIB</code>.</p>

<p>If you want to use Visual C++, Borland C++ or other compilers,
see the appropriate section in <code>readme.packages</code>. <a
name=
"How%20do%20I%20debug%20code%20that%20I%20have%20compiled%20and%20dyn.load-ed%3f">
</a></p>

<h2>7.3 How do I debug code that I have compiled and
dyn.load-ed?</h2>

<p>First, build a version of the R system with debugging
information by</p>

<pre>
make clean
make DEBUG=T
</pre>

<p>and make a debug version of your package by</p>

<pre>
make pkgclean-mypkg
make DEBUG=T pkg-mypkg
</pre>

<p>Then you can debug by</p>

<pre>
gdb /path/to/rw1023/bin/Rgui.exe
</pre>

<p>However, note</p>

<ul>
<li>gdb will only be able to find the source code if we run in the
location where the source was compiled
(<code>rw1023/src/gnuwin32</code> for the main system, <code>
rw1023/src/library/mypkg/src</code> for a package), unless told
otherwise by the <code>directory</code> command. It is most
convenient to set a list of code locations via <code>
directory</code> commands in the file <code>.gdbinit</code> in the
directory from which <code>gdb</code> is run.</li>

<li>It is only possible to set breakpoints in a DLL after the DLL
has been loaded. So a way to examine the function <code>
tukeyline</code> in package <code>eda</code> might be 

<pre>
     gdb ../../../../bin/Rgui.exe
     (gdb) break WinMain
     (gdb) run
     [ stops with R.dll loaded ]
     (gdb) break R_ReadConsole
     (gdb) continue
     [ stops with console running ]
     (gdb) continue
     Rconsole&gt; library(eda)
     (gdb) break tukeyline
     (gdb) clear R_ReadConsole
     (gdb) continue
</pre>

<p>Fortran symbols need an underline appended.</p>
</li>

<li>Windows has little support for signals, so the usual idea of
running a program under a debugger and sending it a signal to
interrupt it and drop control back to the debugger does not work
with <code>mingw32</code> version of <code>gdb</code>. It does
often work with the <code>cygwin</code> version.</li>

<li>We have seen examples in debugging problems with Windows events
that the <code>cygwin gdb</code> was able to catch but which
terminated the <code>mingw32 gdb</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have an X server available on the PC, there is a version
of <code>DDD</code> available that runs under the cygwin emulation
layer (follow the links at <a href="http://www.cygwin.com">
http://www.cygwin.com</a>) and provides a graphical user interface
to <code>gdb</code>. Another (Windows-native) GUI for <code>
gdb</code> is <code>Insight</code>, part of the latest <code>
cygwin</code> version of <code>gdb</code> <a name=
"How%20do%20I%20include%20C++%20code%3f"></a></p>

<h2>7.4 How do I include C++ code?</h2>

<p>You need to do two things:</p>

<p>(a) Write a wrapper to export the symbols you want to call from
R as <code>extern "C"</code>.</p>

<p>(b) Include the C++ libraries in the link to make the DLL.
Suppose <code>X.cc</code> contains your C++ code, and <code>
X_main.cc</code> is the wrapper, as in the example in `<em>Writing
R Extensions</em>'. Then build the DLL by (<code>gcc</code>)</p>

<pre>
...\bin\Rcmd SHLIB X.cc X_main.cc
</pre>

<p>or (VC++, which requires extension <code>.cpp</code>)</p>

<pre>
cl /MT /c X.cpp X_main.cpp
link /dll /out:X.dll /export:X_main X.obj X_main.obj
</pre>

<p>or (Borland C++, which also requires extension <code>
.cpp</code>)</p>

<pre>
bcc32 -u- -WDE X.cpp X_main.cpp
</pre>

<p>and call the entry point(s) in <code>X_R</code>, such as <code>
X_main</code>. Construction of static variables will occur when the
DLL is loaded, and destruction when the DLL is unloaded, usually
when R terminates.</p>

<p>Note that you will not see the messages from this example in the
GUI console: see the next section.</p>

<p>This example is in package <code>cxx_0.0-x.tar.gz</code> in the
<code>src/contrib/Devel</code> section on CRAN, and that can be
compiled as package in the usual way on Windows. <a name=
"The%20output%20from%20my%20C%20code%20disappears."></a></p>

<h2>7.5 The output from my C code disappears. Why?</h2>

<p>The <code>Rgui.exe</code> console is a Windows application:
writing to <code>stdout</code> or <code>stderr</code> will not
produce output in the console. (This will work with <code>
Rterm.exe</code>.) Use <code>Rprintf</code> or <code>
REprintf</code> instead. These are declared in header file <code>
R_ext/PrtUtil.h</code>.</p>

<p>Note that output from the console is delayed (see <a href=
"#The%20output%20to%20the%20console%20seems%20to%20be%20delayed">
The output to the console seems to be delayed</a>), so that you
will not normally see any output before returning to the R prompt.
<a name="The%20output%20from%20my%20Fortran%20code%20disappears.">
</a></p>

<h2>7.6 The output from my Fortran code disappears. Why?</h2>

<p>Writing to Fortran output writes to a file, not the <code>
Rgui</code> console. Use one of the subroutines <code>
dblepr</code>, <code>intpr</code> or <code>realpr</code> documented
in the <em>`Writing R Extensions'</em> manual. <a name=
"The%20console%20freezes%20when%20my%20compiled%20code%20is%20running">
</a></p>

<h2>7.7 The console freezes when my compiled code is running.</h2>

<p>The console, pagers and graphics window all run in the same
thread as the R engine. To allow the console etc to respond to
Windows events, call <code>R_ProcessEvents()</code> periodically
from your compiled code. If you want output to be updated on the
console, call <code>R_FlushConsole()</code> and then <code>
R_ProcessEvents()</code>. <a name=
"The%20Perl%20scripts%20don't%20seem%20to%20work%20under%20Windows%209x%2fME">
</a></p>

<h2>7.8 The Perl scripts don't seem to work under Windows
9x/ME</h2>

<p>Yes, we know that for example <code>Rcmd check</code> can fail
with some versions of Perl on some 16-bit Windows installations.
Usually there are alternatives such as <code>make
pkgcheck-foo</code>, but you could try getting a modern operating
system!</p>
