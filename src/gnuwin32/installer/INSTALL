You can make an install package (rw1061.exe) in the usual Windows style
(by default in Windows 2000 style) by using the installer kit 
Inno Setup 2.0.x, x >= 17  from www.jrsoftware.org.  (Inno Setup 3,
currently in beta, is not supported and will not be until it is released.)

You need the R installation built completely (see ../INSTALL: this
includes making bitmap and Tcl/Tk support and the manuals).
It's worthwhile testing it too!

Go to the parent of this directory and make the distribution zip
files and the recommended packages by

make distribution
make recommended

Then edit ISDIR in ../MkRules and run

make
make clean

You will have rw1061.exe and a set of files miniR* for the floppy-sized
distribution.
