R @RVER@ for Windows
====================

This distribution contains the sources to build a port of R-@RVER@ to
run on Windows 95, 98, ME, NT4, 2000 and XP on Intel/clone chips. See the
file `readme' for fuller details, including how to install the binary
versions.


Building From Source on Windows
===============================

[Some further details, including how to debug, are given in the rw-FAQ.]

First collect the tools that you need.  There is a `portal' with
current links at http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/Rtools/.


Collect the tools
-----------------

You will need suitable versions of at least make, sh, cat, cp, cut,
diff, echo, egrep, expr, grep, ls, mkdir, mv, rm, sed, touch; we use
those from the cygwin distribution
(http://www.cygwin.com/mirrors.html) or (gzip, makeinfo, texindex)
compiled from the sources.  We have packaged a set at
http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/Rtools/tools.zip.  You may need to copy
sh.exe to c:\bin\sh.exe; the exact circumstances are mysterious, but
the error message will be `make[1]: /bin/sh.exe: Command not found'.

BEWARE: `Native' ports of make are _not_ suitable (including that at
the mingw site).  There were also problems with several earlier
versions of the cygwin tools and dll.  To avoid frustration, please
use our tool set, and make sure it is at the front of your path.

We recommend that you use a recent snapshot of the Mingw port of gcc
from http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/.  For example, at the time
of writing, MinGW-1.1.tar.gz based on gcc-2.95.3.  Just unpack this
somewhere and put its bin directory in your path, *after* our tools.

No earlier Mingw compiler has been tested and support for using the
Cygwin compiler has been withdrawn.  If you see errors about `-shared'
not being understood or `__imp_foo' missing, you are not using the
recommended compiler.


The Windows port of perl5, available via
http://www.activestate.com/Products/ActivePerl/.

zip and unzip from the Info-ZIP project (http://www.info-zip.org and
mirrors, and included in our tools.zip).

The zlib-1.1.3 sources from http://www.gzip.org/zlib/ and mirrors.
Unpack this from this directory by

unzip zlib113.zip -d bitmap/zlib

If you want to make compiled html (.chm) files you will need the
Microsoft HTML Help Workshop, currently available for download at

http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/htmlhelp/html/hwMicrosoftHTMLHelpDownloads.asp
and http://www.microsoft.com/office/ork/xp/appndx/appa06.htm

You may need this on the same drive as the other tools. (Although we
have successfully used it elsewhere, others have reported problems).

If you want to make Window help files you will need hcrtf.exe from a
Windows compiler installation (this has been available for download at
ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/softlib/mslfiles/hcwsetup.exe).

All of these need to be installed and in your path, and the
appropriate environment variables set.


Building
--------

You also need the R source (R-@RVER@.tgz).

Then: untar R-@RVER@.tgz somewhere (with no spaces in the path names),

	cd /somewhere/R-@RVER@/src/gnuwin32

IMPORTANT: edit MkRules to set the appropriate paths as needed.

Edit Makefile to set the type(s) of help that you want built.

and run

	make


Note 1: the file @RWVER@\unzip\unzip32.dll is not in the source
distribution. It can be found in file unz542dN.zip at any Info-ZIP
mirror, or you can copy it from a binary distribution.

The file @RWVER@\bin\Rchtml.dll is only built if CHM help is specified
in the main Makefile. Its source is the help directory, and you need
the HTML Help Workshop files to build it. It contains instructions
to build it under VC++6, and it is preferable to use that as the 
VC++ library will check versions of the components needed. You can just
copy this from a binary distribution.

Note 2: we have had reports that Norton Anti-Virus locks up the
machine when windres is run, so you may need to disable it.

Note 3: By default Doug Lea's malloc in the file src/gnuwin32/malloc.c is
used.  You can opt out of this by commenting the line LEA_MALLOC=YES
in the Makefile, in which case the Windows malloc is used.  The one
in crtdll.dll is unlikely to be satisfactory: the one in msvcrt.dll
does work but imposes a considerable performance penalty.

Note 4: You can make use of ATLAS (http://www.netlib.org/atlas/)
libraries by defining USE_ATLAS=YES in Makefile and specifying the
path to the libraries in macro ATLAS_PATH.  You will need to build the
libraries optimized for your architecture under the Cygwin compilers.
(The pre-compiled libraries on that site are for Compaq Visual
Fortran, and you need to compile for g77.)

You can test a build by `make check': expect some differences in the
tests of the print routines.  You may need to set TMPDIR to a suitable
temporary directory: the default is c:\TEMP.


Building bitmap device support
------------------------------

The file @RWVER@\bin\Rbitmap.dll is not built automatically:
instructions on how to build it are in the file bitmap\INSTALL.


Building Tcl/Tk support
-----------------------

The TclTk support package is not built automatically.  To use this you
need to download and install either ActiveTcl 8.3.3 from
http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Downloads/ActiveTcl/ or tcl832.exe
from dev.scriptics.com, and set TCL_HOME in MkRules to where you
installed it (perhaps c:/Program Files/Tcl).  Then

	make tcl

will make the library.



Building the Manuals
====================

To make the PDF versions of the manuals you will need pdftex installed
and configured to work with a large file: see doc/manual/README.  You
also need texindex (included in our tool set).  Then the pdf manuals
can be made by

	make docs

If you want to make the info versions (not the Reference Manual), you
will need a version of makeinfo 4.0 (included in our tool set). Then

	cd ../../doc/manual
	make -f Makefile.win info

will make the info files.

To make DVI versions of the manuals use

	cd ../../doc/manual
	make -f Makefile.win dvi

(assuming you have tex and latex installed and in your path).

To make HTML versions of the manuals (not the Reference Manual) use

	cd ../../doc/manual
	make -f Makefile.win html

This makes use of tidy.exe, from http://www.w3.org/.

The fptex distribution of TeX (via www.fptex.org) includes a suitable
port of pdftex.


Building the installers
=======================

See installer/INSTALL.  You need a complete R build first, including 
bitmap and Tcl/Tk support and the manuals, as well as the recommended
packages in R-@RVER@-recommended.tgz.


Recommended packages
====================

The recommended packages can in the main be built as any other package.
boot, cluster, nlme, rpart and survival should be made with
Rcmd INSTALL --use-zip

KernSmooth, mgcv and VR can be made by Rcmd INSTALL.  Package spatial
(in VR) will not work if its data directory is zipped.

foreign needs more work: unpack it and rename src/*.h.in to remove .in
from the names.  Then INSTALL the package.

You cannot currently use Rcmd CHECK to install and check a package
with --use-zip.


Cross-building on ix86 Linux
============================

You will need i386-mingw32 cross-compilers installed and in your path,
and you probably need ones targetted at msvcrt.dll.  There is
currently a complete set of tools at

    http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/Rtools/i386-msvc-cross.tar.bz2

(Just unpack this somewhere and put its bin directory in your path.)

Instructions for building a cross-compiler are given at

    http://www.nanotech.wisc.edu/~khan/software/gnu-win32/mingw-cross-howto.txt

At the time of writing these were rather outdated.  There is another set
at

    http://www.devolution.com/%7Eslouken/SDL/Xmingw32/

(There is also a cross-compiler there, but omitting g77 which you will
need.)

Apart from the compiler, you need the mingw32 runtime system and a
cross-built version of binutils 2.9.4.

You will need Perl, zip and unzip installed.

You also need the R source (R-@RVER@.tgz).

Then: untar R-@RVER@.tgz somewhere, and

	cd /somewhere/R-@RVER@/src/gnuwin32

Edit MkRules to set BUILD=CROSS and the appropriate paths (including
HEADER) as needed.

Edit Makefile to set the type(s) of help that you want built. (You
will not be able to cross-build .chm or .hlp files, nor Rchtml.dll,
so set WINHELP to NO.)

Packages can be made in the same way as natively: see the file
readme.packages.  You will need to set STAMP=NO, e.g.

	make STAMP=NO pkg-foo

Note that cross-building does still need libR.a, and that to
cross-build the methods package you need a working copy of this
version of R on the Linux system.

(It is possible to cross-build the main installers using WINE, which
we leave as an exercise for the reader.)
