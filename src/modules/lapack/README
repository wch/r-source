The Fortran routines here are extracted from LAPACK 3.0
(http://www.netlib.org/lapack and mirrors).

double.f are support routines for `real' LAPACK calls
cmplx.f are support routines for LAPACK calls from complex arithmetic
routines, that are only used if COMPLEX*16 is supported by the Fortran
compiler and compatible with the Rcomplex type (guaranteed for f2c users).

blas2.f contains additional (to src/appl/blas.f) BLAS routines needed
by double.f.

cmplxblas.f contains BLAS routines needed by cmplx.f.

blas2.f and complxblas.f are not used if a full BLAS implementation is
found at configure time.

Do not be tempted to replace double.f and cmplx.f by another LAPACK
installation.  dgeev.f had to be corrected (lines 3047-8 of double.f)
to allow LWORK queries to run.
