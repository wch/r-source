The Fortran routines here were extracted from LAPACK 3.1.0, then
3.1.1, 3.4.1, 3.4.2, 3.5.0, 3.6.0, 3.6.1, 3.7.0.
(Sources from http://www.netlib.org/lapack and mirrors).

dlapack.f contains support routines for `real' LAPACK calls.  
cmplx.f contains support routines for LAPACK calls from complex
arithmetic routines, that are only used if COMPLEX*16 is supported by
the Fortran compiler and compatible with the Rcomplex type.
Neither will be compiled if an external LAPACK is used.

We have tried to avoid including any single-precision routines.


Preparation
-----------

dlapack.f and cmplx.f were created in the LAPACK 3.7.0 sources by

dir.create('dble')
foo <- scan('dble.txt', "")
file.copy(file.path("SRC", foo), 'dble')
system('cpp SRC/iparam2stage.F > dble/iparam2stage.f')
system("cat dble/* > dlapack.f")

dir.create('cmplx ')
foo <- scan('cmplx.txt', "")
file.copy(file.path("SRC", foo), 'cmplx')
system("cat cmplx/* > cmplx.f")

If you update the LAPACK version, you need to copy over the LICENSE
file and update it in doc/copyrights.  And if you patch the sources,
*DO* mention it here and add the patch to R.patch.

New LAPACK versions (even point releases) often add new auxiliary
routines, and these can be hard to track down.  I found it helpful to
compare the outputs of

nm -g dlapack.o | grep ' T ' | cut -b20-
nm -g dlapack.o | grep ' U ' | cut -b20-

before and after upating (ditto for cmplx.o).  (This may need
adjusting for your platform's nm.)
