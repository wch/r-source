\section{Introduction}

The \code{reshape()} function reshapes datasets in the so-called
\sQuote{wide} format (with repeated measurements in separate columns
of the same row) to the \sQuote{long} format (with the repeated
measurements in separate rows), and vice versa.

\code{reshape()} is a somewhat complicated function, and this vignette
gives a few examples of how it can be used.  Although \code{reshape()}
can be used in a variety of contexts, the motivating application is
data from longitudinal studies, and the arguments of this function are
named and described in those terms. See the documentation
(\code{help(reshape)}) for background and detailed usage.

For our examples, we will simulate data from a study where individuals
are measured at two time points. Two of the measurements are
time-varying: height and weight, and one of the measurements is
time-constant: sex.


\section{Conversion from wide to long format}

We first simulate data in the wide format. Data from each individual
is contained in one row, with one column for time-constant variables
and multiple columns for time-varying variables. Here there are two
time points (before and after), so there are two columns for each
time-varying variable.

<<>>=
set.seed(12345)
n <- 5
d1 <- data.frame(sex = sample(c("M", "F"), n, rep = TRUE),
                 ht.before = round(rnorm(n, 165, 6), 1),
                 ht.after = round(rnorm(n, 165, 6), 1),
                 wt.before = round(rnorm(n, 80, 6)),
                 wt.after = round(rnorm(n, 80, 6)))
d1
@

Suppose we want to convert this dataset into the long format, with two
rows for each individual, and one column for each variable (both
time-constant and time-varying). Such a representation will need two
additional variables to distinguish between multiple rows
corresponding to the same individual (corresponding to one row in the
wide format): a time-variable and an id-variable. These will be
automatically created when converting from wide to long format.

However, we do need to specify which columns in the wide format
correspond to the same time-varying variable(s). This is easiest to do
when we have only one time-varying variable. Although we have two such
in our example, let us pretend that only height is time-varying. The
corresponding columns can be specified as the \code{varying} argument.
The two weight variables will then be assumed to be different
time-constant variables, similar to sex.

%% specify only ht variables as time-variables (wt variables assumed
%% to be separate time constant variables)

<<>>=
reshape(d1, direction = "long",
        varying = c("ht.before", "ht.after"))
@

It is equivalent to specify the variables as column indices.

<<>>=
reshape(d1, direction = "long",
        varying = c(2, 3))
@

Note that the names of the combined variable, as well as the values of
the time variable, are automatically detected because the names happen
to be \dQuote{nicely} formatted.  Suppose we instead had

<<>>=
n <- 5
d2 <- data.frame(sex = sample(c("M", "F"), n, rep = TRUE),
                 ht_before = round(rnorm(n, 165, 6), 1),
                 ht_after = round(rnorm(n, 165, 6), 1),
                 wt_before = round(rnorm(n, 80, 6)),
                 wt_after = round(rnorm(n, 80, 6)))
@

Modifying the previous call gives:

%% Error: Fails to guess

<<>>=
try(
reshape(d2, direction = "long",
        varying = c("wt_before", "wt_after")),
)
@

This is easy to \dQuote{fix} in this case because the names are still
nicely formatted, just not using the separator that \code{reshape()}
expects by default. 

<<>>=
reshape(d2, direction = "long",
        varying = c("wt_before", "wt_after"), sep = "_")
@

A more general solution is to specify the name of the new combined
column explicitly as the \code{v.names} argument.

<<>>=
reshape(d2, direction = "long",
        varying = c("wt_before", "wt_after"),
        v.names = "weight") 
@

We can additionally specify the names and values of the id / time
variables as well.

<<>>=
reshape(d2, direction = "long",
        varying = c("wt_before", "wt_after"),
        v.names = "weight", 
        timevar = "when", times = c("pre", "post"),
        idvar = "subject", ids = letters[1:n])
@

Note that the \code{times} argument is ignored when automatic guessing
is performed, i.e., when \code{v.names} is not explicitly specified.

<<>>=
reshape(d2, direction = "long",
        varying = c("wt_before", "wt_after"), sep = "_",
        ## v.names = "wt", # without this, 'times' is unused 
        timevar = "when", times = c("pre", "post"))
@

So far, we have only specified one time-varying variable, but our data
actually has two. How do we specify multiple time-varying variables?
This depends on whether the variable names are in a guessable format.


\subsection{Explicitly specifying variables names}

The general approach is to explicitly specify both \code{varying} and
\code{v.names} as before. \code{v.names} should be a vector of new
variable names in the long format, and \code{varying} should either be
a list, with each component giving the corresponding wide format
variable names, or a matrix, with each row giving the corresponding
wide format variable names.


<<>>=
reshape(d2, direction = "long",
        varying = list(c("ht_before", "ht_after"),
                       c("wt_before", "wt_after")), # list form
        v.names = c("height", "weight"),
        times = c("pre", "post"))

reshape(d2, direction = "long",
        varying = rbind(c("ht_before", "ht_after"),
                        c("wt_before", "wt_after")), # matrix form
        v.names = c("height", "weight"))
@

The \code{times} argument has been omitted in the second example
above, and the default is to use sequential times. The \code{v.names}
argument can be omitted as well, but the default is not generally
sensible.

Of course, the time and id variables can also be controlled in the
usual way as long as \code{v.names} is specified.

<<>>=
reshape(d2, direction = "long",
        varying = rbind(c("ht_before", "ht_after"),
                        c("wt_before", "wt_after")),
        v.names = c("height", "weight"),
        timevar = "when",
        times = c("pre", "post"),
        idvar = "subject",
        ids = letters[1:n])
@



\subsection{Variables names in a guessable format}


Even when variable names are in a guessable format, \code{reshape()}
will not try to guess if multiple time-varying variables are provided
as a list or matrix.  However, when the wide format variable names are
suitably formatted in the same manner for all time-varying variables,
it is still possible to take advantage of automatic guessing by
specifying the \code{varying} argument as an atomic vector (of either
names or indices) containing all time-varying columns.

<<>>=
reshape(d2, direction = "long",
        varying = c("ht_before", "ht_after",
                    "wt_before", "wt_after"), sep = "_")
@


The atomic vector form of \code{varying} can be combined with explicit
(non-guessed) specification of \code{v.names} as well, but in that
case, one needs to pay careful attention to the order of variable
names in \code{varying}. The following gives wrong results:

<<>>=
reshape(d2, direction = "long",
        varying = c("ht_before", "ht_after",
                    "wt_before", "wt_after"),
        v.names = c("height", "weight"))
@

The correct order requires all columns corresponding to the same time
to be contiguous; this is the same intrinsic column-major ordering in
the matrix form above. It is best to avoid the atomic vector form of
\code{varying} unless \code{v.names} is being omitted.

<<echo=FALSE,eval=FALSE>>=
reshape(d2, direction = "long",
        varying = c("ht_before", "wt_before",
                    "ht_after", "wt_after"),
        v.names = c("height", "weight"))
@


\subsection{Repeated application of reshape}


Just as an illustration, let us try to create an even longer dataset
that combines height and weight together in a single column.

<<>>=
dlong <- 
    reshape(d2, direction = "long",
            varying = c("ht_before", "wt_before",
                        "ht_after", "wt_after"),
            v.names = c("height", "weight"),
            timevar = "when", times = c("pre", "post"),
            idvar = "subject", ids = letters[1:n])
reshape(dlong, direction = "long",
        varying = c("height", "weight"),
        v.names = "combined",
        timevar = "what", times = c("height", "weight"))
@

Can we get this directly from \code{d2} using a single
\code{reshape()} call?  We can, except that we will get a composite
time variable (which can be easily split if needed).

<<>>=
reshape(d2, direction = "long",
        v.names = "combined",
        varying = c("ht_before", "ht_after", "wt_before", "wt_after"),
        timevar = "when_what",
        times = c("pre_height", "post_height", "pre_weight", "post_weight"),
        idvar = "subject", ids = letters[1:n])
@


\section{Conversion from wide to long format}

Conversion from long to wide format is generally simpler. Let us
simulate long format data from the same hypothetical setup.

<<>>=
d3 <- data.frame(sex = sample(c("M", "F"), 2 * n, rep = TRUE),
                 ht = round(rnorm(2 * n, 165, 6), 1),
                 wt = round(rnorm(2 * n, 80, 6)),
                 subject = rep(1:n, 2),
                 when = rep(c("pre", "post"), each = n))
d3
@

To convert this to the wide format, the arguments \code{idvar} and
\code{timevar} to \code{reshape()} are mandatory, and all other
variables are assumed to be time-varying.  This is what we do in the
next example, where even \code{sex} is erroneously treated as
time-varying.

<<>>=
reshape(d3, direction = "wide",
        idvar = "subject", timevar = "when")
@

To specify some variables as time-constant, the time-varying variables
must be explicitly specified through \code{v.names}.

<<eval=FALSE>>=
reshape(d3, direction = "wide",
        idvar = "subject", timevar = "when",
        v.names = c("ht", "wt"))
@

This gives a warning because \code{sex} is not really time-constant
in the dataset we have created. Let us fix that:

<<>>=
n <- 10
d4 <- data.frame(sex = rep(sample(c("M", "F"), n, rep = TRUE), 2),
                 ht = round(rnorm(2 * n, 165, 6), 1),
                 wt = round(rnorm(2 * n, 80, 6)),
                 subject = rep(1:n, 2),
                 when = rep(c("pre", "post"), each = n))
reshape(d4, direction = "wide",
        idvar = "subject", timevar = "when",
        v.names = c("ht", "wt"), sep = "_")
@

To specify the resulting wide format variable names explicitly instead
of using the automatically constructed defaults, we may use the
\code{varying} argument as in wide-to-long conversion. As in that
case, \code{varying} can be a vector of variable names, where the same
caveats apply regarding order.

<<>>=
reshape(d4, direction = "wide",
        idvar = "subject", timevar = "when",
        v.names = c("ht", "wt"),
        varying = c("h_before", "w_before", "h_after", "w_after"))
@

%% Pre 4.1.0: Error in varying[, i] : incorrect number of dimensions

For more than one time-varying variable, it is safer to avoid the
vector form and instead specify \code{varying} as a list or matrix.

<<>>=
reshape(d4, direction = "wide",
        idvar = "subject", timevar = "when",
        v.names = c("ht", "wt"),
        varying = list(c("h_before", "h_after"),
                       c("w_before", "w_after")))
