c     --------   ------
c      implicit none

C calculates value and deriv.s of all b-splines which do not vanish at x
C calls bsplvb
c
c******  i n p u t  ******
c  t     the knot array, of length left+k (at least)
c  k     the order of the b-splines to be evaluated
c  x     the point at which these values are sought
c  left  an integer indicating the left endpoint of the interval of
c        interest. the  k  b-splines whose support contains the interval
c               (t(left), t(left+1))
c        are to be considered.
c  a s s u m p t i o n  - - -  it is assumed that
c               t(left) < t(left+1)
c        division by zero will result otherwise (in  b s p l v b ).
c        also, the output is as advertised only if
c               t(left) <= x <= t(left+1) .
c  nderiv   an integer indicating that values of b-splines and their
c        derivatives up to but not including the  nderiv-th  are asked
c        for. ( nderiv  is replaced internally by the integer in (1,k)
c        closest to it.)
c
c******  w o r k   a r e a  ******
c  a     an array of order (k,k), to contain b-coeff.s of the derivat-
c        ives of a certain order of the  k  b-splines of interest.
c
c******  o u t p u t  ******
c  dbiatx   an array of order (k,nderiv). its entry  (i,m)  contains
c        value of  (m-1)st  derivative of  (left-k+i)-th  b-spline of
c        order  k  for knot sequence  t , i=m,...,k; m=1,...,nderiv.
c
c******  m e t h o d  ******
c  values at  x  of all the relevant b-splines of order k,k-1,...,
c  k+1-nderiv  are generated via  bsplvb  and stored temporarily
c  in  dbiatx .  then, the b-coeffs of the required derivatives of the
c  b-splines of interest are generated by differencing, each from the
c  preceding one of lower order, and combined with the values of b-
c  splines of corresponding order in  dbiatx  to produce the desired
c  values.

c     the first column of  dbiatx  always contains the b-spline values

c        of order m there is safe since the remaining b-spline derivat-
