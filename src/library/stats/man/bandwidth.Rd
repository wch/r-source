\usage{
bw.nrd0(x)

bw.nrd(x)

bw.ucv(x, nb = 1000, lower = 0.1 * hmax, upper = hmax,
       tol = 0.1 * lower)

bw.bcv(x, nb = 1000, lower = 0.1 * hmax, upper = hmax,
       tol = 0.1 * lower)

bw.SJ(x, nb = 1000, lower = 0.1 * hmax, upper = hmax,
      method = c("ste", "dpi"), tol = 0.1 * lower)
}
\arguments{
  \item{x}{numeric vector.}
  \item{nb}{number of bins to use.}
  \item{lower, upper}{range over which to minimize.  The default is
    almost always satisfactory.  \code{hmax} is calculated internally
    from a normal reference bandwidth.}
  \item{method}{either \code{"ste"} ("solve-the-equation") or
    \code{"dpi"} ("direct plug-in").   Can be abbreviated.}
  \item{tol}{for method \code{"ste"}, the convergence tolerance for
    \code{\link{uniroot}}.  The default leads to bandwidth estimates
    with only slightly more than one digit accuracy, which is sufficient
    for practical density estimation, but possibly not for theoretical
    simulation studies.}

\description{
  Bandwidth selectors for Gaussian kernels in \code{\link{density}}.
}

\details{
  \code{bw.nrd0} implements a rule-of-thumb for
  choosing the bandwidth of a Gaussian kernel density estimator.
  It defaults to 0.9 times the
  minimum of the standard deviation and the interquartile range divided by
  1.34 times the sample size to the negative one-fifth power
  (= Silverman's \sQuote{rule of thumb}, Silverman (1986, page 48, eqn (3.31))
  \emph{unless} the quartiles coincide when a positive result
  will be guaranteed.

  \code{bw.nrd} is the more common variation given by Scott (1992),
  using factor 1.06.

  \code{bw.ucv} and \code{bw.bcv} implement unbiased and
  biased cross-validation respectively.

  \code{bw.SJ} implements the methods of Sheather & Jones (1991)
  to select the bandwidth using pilot estimation of derivatives.\cr
  The algorithm for method \code{"ste"} solves an equation (via
  \code{\link{uniroot}}) and because of that, enlarges the interval
  \code{c(lower, upper)} when the boundaries were not user-specified and
  do not bracket the root.

  The last three methods use all pairwise binned distances: they are of
  complexity \eqn{O(n^2)} up to \code{n = nb/2} and \eqn{O(n)}
  thereafter.  Because of the binning, the results differ slightly when
  \code{x} is translated or sign-flipped.
}
\value{
  A bandwidth on a scale suitable for the \code{bw} argument
  of \code{density}.
}
\note{
  Long vectors \code{x} are not supported, but neither are they by
  \code{\link{density}} and kernel density estimation and for more than
  a few thousand points a histogram would be preferred.
