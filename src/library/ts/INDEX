Time-series package for R
=========================

Functions in base R:
-------------------

ts		Create a (univariate or multivariate) ts object
[.ts		Subsetting method for ts objects.
as.ts, is.ts	Coercion and membership functions
plot, lines,  print	methods

cbind.ts	cbind method for time series (aligns time bases)
na.omit.ts	na.omit method for time series: omits at ends only
Ops.ts		arithmetic (such as + - * /) for time series

aggregate	Computes summaries (e.g. sum) over disjoint time intervals
diff		Lagged differences of a time series
end		Time of last observation
frequency	Number of observations per unit of time
deltat		Return time interval between observations
time		Create time series giving the times of observations
cycle		Create time series giving the positions in a cycle 
		   of a time series
start		Time of first observation
tsp, tsp<-	Get and set time-series attributes
window		Subset to a time window

StructTS        Fit Structural Time Series
toeplitz	Generate Toeplitz matrix
ts.intersect	Bind time series as multivariate ts over the common time base
ts.plot		Plot several time series with different time bases
ts.union	Bind time series as multivariate ts over their total time base
tsdiag          Diagnostic Plots for Time-Series Fits
tsSmooth        Use Fixed-Interval Smoothing on Time Series

In some cases the visual output will closer to that of S(-PLUS) if
options(ts.S.compat=TRUE) has been set.
