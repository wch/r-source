paste <- function (..., sep = " ", collapse = NULL)
    .Internal(paste(list(...), sep, collapse))
paste0 <- function(..., collapse = NULL)
    .Internal(paste0(list(...), collapse))

##=== Could we extend  paste(.) to (optionally) accept a
##    2-vector for collapse ?	 With the following functionality

##- paste.extra <- function(r, collapse=c(", "," and ")) {
##-	    n <- length(r)
##-	    if(n <= 1) paste(r)
##-	    else
##-	      paste(paste(r[-n],collapse=collapse[1L]),
##-		    r[n], sep=collapse[min(2,length(collapse))])
##- }
