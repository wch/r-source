\title{Evaluate an Expression in a Data Environment}
\description{
  Evaluate an \R expression in an environment constructed from data,
  possibly modifying (a copy of) the original data.
}
\usage{
with(data, expr, \dots)
within(data, expr, \dots)
}
\arguments{
  \item{data}{data to use for constructing an environment. For the
    default \code{with} method this may be an environment, a list, a
    data frame, or an integer as in \code{sys.call}. For \code{within},
    it can be a list or a data frame.}
  \item{expr}{expression to evaluate.}
  \item{\dots}{arguments to be passed to future methods.}
}
\details{
  \code{with} is a generic function that evaluates \code{expr} in a
  local environment constructed from \code{data}.  The environment has
  the caller's environment as its parent.  This is useful for
  simplifying calls to modeling functions.  (Note: if \code{data} is
  already an environment then this is used with its existing parent.)

  Note that assignments within \code{expr} take place in the constructed
  environment and not in the user's workspace.

  \code{within} is similar, except that it examines the environment
  after the evaluation of \code{expr} and makes the corresponding
  modifications to a copy of \code{data} (this may fail in the data
  frame case if objects are created which cannot be stored in a data
  frame), and returns it.  \code{within} can be used as an alternative
  to \code{transform}.
}
\note{
  For \emph{interactive} use this is very effective and nice to read.  For
  \emph{programming} however, i.e., in one's functions, more care is
  needed, and typically one should refrain from using \code{with()}, as,
  e.g., variables in \code{data} may accidentally override local
  variables, see the reference.

  Further, when using modeling or graphics functions with an explicit
  \code{data} argument (and typically using \code{\link{formula}}s),
  it is typically preferred to use the \code{data} argument of that
  function rather than to use \code{with(data, ...)}.
}
\value{
  For \code{with}, the value of the evaluated \code{expr}.  For
  \code{within}, the modified object.
