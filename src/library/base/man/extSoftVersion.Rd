\title{
  Report Versions of Third-Party Software
}
\description{
  Report versions of (external) third-party software used.
}
\usage{
extSoftVersion()
}
\details{
  The reports the versions of third-party software libraries in use.
  These are often external but might have been compiled into \R when it
  was installed.

  With dynamic linking, these are the versions of the libraries linked
  to in this session: with static linking, of those compiled in.
}
\value{
  A named character vector, currently with components
  \item{zlib}{The version of \code{zlib} in use.}
  \item{bzlib}{The version of \code{bzlib} (from \command{bzip2}) in use.}
  \item{xz}{The version of \code{liblzma} (from \command{xz}) in use.}
  \item{PCRE}{The version of \code{PCRE} in use.}
  \item{ICU}{The version of \code{ICU} in use (if any, otherwise \code{""}).}
  \item{TRE}{The version of \code{libtre} in use.}
  \item{iconv}{The implementation and version of the \code{iconv}
  library in use (if known).}
  \item{readline}{The version of \code{readline} in use (if any,
  otherwise \code{""}).}
  \item{BLAS}{Name of the binary/executable file with the implementation of
  \code{BLAS} in use (if known, otherwise \code{""}).}
  \item{LAPACK}{The API version of LAPACK in use (the result of calling
  \code{\link{La_version}()}). If known, the name of the binary/executable
  file with the implementation of \code{LAPACK} in use is appended, using
  \code{" "} as separator.}

  Note that the values for \code{bzlib} and \code{pcre} normally contain
  a date as well as the version number, and that for \code{tre} includes
  several items separated by spaces, the version number being the
  second.

  For \code{iconv} this will give the implementation as well as the
  version, for example \code{"GNU libiconv 1.14"}, \code{"glibc
  2.18"} or \code{"win_iconv"} (which has no version number).

  The name of the binary/executable file for \code{BLAS} and \code{LAPACK}
  can be used as an indication of which implementation is in use. 
  Typically, the R version of BLAS will appear as \code{libR.so}
  (\code{libR.dylib}), \code{R} or \code{libRblas.so}
  (\code{libRblas.dylib}), depending on how R was built.  Note that
  \code{libRblas.so} (\code{libRblas.dylib}) may also be shown for an
  external BLAS implementation that had been copied, hard-linked or renamed
  by the system administrator.  For an external BLAS, a shared object file
  will be given and its path/name may indicate the vendor/version. 
  Typically, the \R version of LAPACK will appear as \code{libRlapack.so}
  (\code{libRlapack.dylib}), but again this name may also be shown for an
  external implementation of LAPACK that had been given this name.  The
  detection does not work on Windows.
