We make chartables.h rather than pcre_chartables.c, and include in 
pcre_compile.c.  This makes the standard dependency mechanism work.

pcre_dfa_exec.c had two unused variables.

pcre_internal.h includes the relevant definitions that configure would
make.

In pcre.h, we don't want to make a DLL on Windows, and we don't allow C++.
