[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wch/r-source.svg?branch=build-trunk)](https://travis-ci.org/wch/r-source)

This branch builds R-devel continuously when there are SVN commits and deploys the results to S3.

It adds two files absent from the R SVN repository, [.travis.yml](.travis.yml) and this file, [README.md](README.md).

For more information on R itself see [README](README)
