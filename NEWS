		CHANGES IN R VERSION 2.5.1


NEW FEATURES

    o	density(1:20, bw = "SJ") now works as bw.SJ() now tries a larger
	search interval than the default (lower, upper) if it does not
	find a solution within the latter.

    o	The output of library() (no arguments) is now sorted by library
	trees in the order of .libPaths() and not alphabetically.

    o	R_LIBS_USER and R_LIBS_SITE feature possible expansion of
    	specifiers for R version specific information as part of the
    	startup process.

    o	C-level warning calls now print a more informative context,
	as C-level errors have for a while.

    o	There is a new option "rl_word_breaks" to control the way the
	input line is tokenized in the readline-based terminal
	interface for object- and file-name completion.
	This allows it to be tuned for people who use their space bar
	vs those who do not.  The default now allows filename-completion
	with +-* in the filenames.

    o	If the srcfile argument to parse() is not NULL, it will be added
    	to the result as a "srcfile" attribute.

    o	It is no longer possible to interrupt lazy-loading (which was
	only at all likely when lazy-loading environments), which
	would leave the object being loaded in an unusable state.
	This is a temporary measure: error-recovery when evaluating
	promises will be tackled more comprehensively in 2.6.0.


INSTALLATION

    o	'make check' will work with --without-iconv, to accommodate
	building on AIX where the system iconv conflicts with
	libiconv and is not compatible with R's requirements.

    o	There is support for 'DESTDIR': see the R-admin manual.

    o	The texinfo manuals are now converted to HTML with a style
	sheet: in recent versions of makeinfo the markup such as @file
	was being lost in the HTML rendering.

    o	The use of inlining has been tweaked to avoid warnings from
	gcc >= 4.2.0 when compiling in C99 mode (which is the default
	from configure).


BUG FIXES

    o	as.dendrogram() failed on objects of class "dendrogram".

    o	plot(type ="s") (or "S") with many (hundreds of thousands)
	of points could overflow the stack.  (PR#9629)

    o	Coercing an S4 classed object to "matrix" (or other basic class)
	failed to unset the S4 bit.

    o	The 'useS4' argument of print.default() had been broken by an
	unrelated change prior to 2.4.1.  This allowed print() and
	show() to bounce badly constructed S4 objects between
	themselves indefinitely.

    o	Prediction of the seasonal component in HoltWinters() was one
	step out at one point in the calculations.

	decompose() incorrectly computed the 'random' component for a
	multiplicative fit.

    o	Wildcards work again in unlink() on Unix-alikes (they did not
	in 2.5.0).

    o	When qr() used pivoting, the coefficient names in qr.coef() were
	not pivoted to match.  (PR#9623)

    o	UseMethod() could crash R if the first argument was not a
	character string.

    o	R and Rscript on Unix-alikes were not accepting spaces in -e
	arguments (even if quoted).

    o	Hexadecimal integer constants (e.g. 0x10L) were not being parsed
	correctly on platforms where the C function atof did not
	accept hexadecimal prefixes (as required by C99, but not
	implemented in MinGW as used by R on Windows).  (PR#9648)

    o	libRlapack.dylib on Mac OS X had no version information and
	sometimes an invalid identification name.

    o	Rd conversion of \usage treated '\\' as a single backslash in
	all but latex: it now acts consistently with the other
	verbatim-like environments (it was never 'verbatim' despite
	the documentation).

	\code{\.} is now rendered as '\.' in all formats, as
	documented (it was not the case for latex conversion).

	codoc() (and checkDocStyle() and checkDocUsage()) now apply
	the same transformations to \usage as Rd conversion does,
	so {, % and \\ in strings in usages will now be related
	correctly to the help files.

    o	rbind() failed if the only data frame had 0 rows. (PR#9657)

    o	<a data.frame>[i, j] could sometimes select the wrong column
	when j is numeric if there are duplicate column names.

    o	sample(x, size, replace=TRUE, prob) had a memory leak if
	10000 < size <= 100000.

    o	x <- cbind(1:2); rownames(x) <- factor(c("A",NA))  now longer
	segfaults.

    o	R CMD BATCH no longer assumes Sys.unsetenv() is supported (it
	is not on older Solaris systems).

    o	median() returned a logical result when it was 'NA': it now
	returns an NA of appropriate type (e.g. integer or double).

    o	grep(fixed = TRUE, perl = TRUE) ignored 'fixed', although it
	was documented to ignore 'perl'
	Same for [g]regexpr and [g]sub.

    o	getNamespaceExports("base") works again.

    o	runmed(c(), 1) no longer segfaults.

    o	qr.coef(QR, b) failed for an LAPACK-produced QR if b was
	integer or for an over-determined system.

	qr.solve() for an under-determined system produces a
	solution with 0 and not NA for columns which are unused.

    o	segments() was not handling full transparency correctly in PDF.
	(PR#9694)

	Nor was arrows().

    o	callGeneric() inside a method with extra arguments {and hence
	currently defined via .local()} now works.

    o	[g]sub(fixed=TRUE, useBytes=FALSE) could substitute in the
	wrong place in an MBCS locale.

	gregexpr() could give incorrect answers in MBCS locales for
	perl = TRUE or fixed = TRUE (unless useBytes = TRUE).

    o   The legacy quartz() device no longer crashes in locator()
	if the user attempts to close the window.

    o	"CGGStackRestore: gstack underflow" warning is no longer shown
	in legacy quartz() device.

    o	formatC() now limits 'digits' to 50 to avoid problems in
	C-level sprintf in some OSes.

    o	seq.int(x, y, by=z) gave 'x' (and not an error) if
	0 > (y-x)/z > -1.

    o	promptClass() now lists methods, including those for generics in
	other attached packages.

    o	Connection-related functions such as readBin() no longer crash
	when supplied with a non-connection object.

    o	as.character.srcref() didn't handle bad srcref objects cleanly.

    o	predict.nls() no longer requires 'newdata' to contain exactly
	the variable names needed to fit the model: variables used on
	the LHS only are no longer required and further variables are
	allowed.

    o	plot.hclust() had a 'out by one' error, and ignored the last
	object when computing the window region (and could overrun
	arrays).

    o	deriv() was creating results with double (and not integer) dims.

    o	The unserialize code (e.g. as called by load()) looked for a
	function findPackageEnv() to set a saved package environment.
	This was missing, but is now supplied.

    o	[cr]bind could segfault when creating a list matrix result.
	(Reported by Martin Morgan.)

    o	besselI(x, nu, exp=TRUE) and besselY(x, nu) could give wrong
	answers for nu < 0. (Reported by Hiroyuki Kawakatsu.)



		CHANGES IN R VERSION 2.5.0


USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o	apropos(x) and find(x) now both only work for character 'x',
	and hence drop all non-standard evaluation behaviour.

    o	Data frames can have 'automatic' row names which are not
	converted to dimnames by as.matrix().  (Consequently, e.g.,
	t(.)  for such data frames has NULL column names.)  This
	change leads to memory reductions in several places, but can
	break code which assumes character dimnames for data frames
	derived from matrices.

	No existing R object is regarded as having 'automatic' row
	names, and it may be beneficial to recreate such objects via
	read.table() or data.frame().

    o	Using $ on an atomic vector now raises a warning, as does use
	on an S4 class for which a method has not been defined.

    o	The Unix-alike readline terminal interface now does
	command-completion for R objects, incorporating the
	functionality formerly in package 'rcompletion' by Deepayan
	Sarkar.  This can be disabled by setting the environment
	variable R_COMPLETION=FALSE when starting R (e.g. in
	~/.Renviron).  (Note that when this is enabled, filename
	completion no longer works for file paths containing R
	operators such as '+' and '-'.)


NEW FEATURES

    o	abbreviate() no longer has an 8191 byte limit on the size of
	strings it can handle.

    o	abs(x) now returns integer for integer or logical arguments.

    o	apropos() has a new argument 'ignore.case' which defaults to
	TRUE, potentially matching more than previously, thanks to a
	suggestion by Seth Falcon.

    o	args(), str() and print() now give the argument lists of primitive
	functions.

    o	as.matrix() gains the '...' argument that several packages have
	assumed it always had (and S-PLUS has).

    o	Manipulation of integers as roman numerals via as.roman() in
	package utils.

    o	attr() no longer treats name = NA_character_ as meaning
	name = "NA".

    o	binom.test() now allows a 'fuzz' for calculated integer values
	in its x and n arguments.

    o	boxplot(*, notch = TRUE) now warns when notches are outside
	hinges; related to PR#7690.

    o	New function callCC() providing a downward-only version of
	Scheme's call with current continuation.

    o	capabilities() now has a "profmem" entry indicating whether
	R has been compiled with memory profiling.

    o	colnames<-() and rownames<-() now handle data frames explicitly,
	so calling colnames<- on a data frame no longer alters the
	representation of the row names.

    o	commandArgs() has a new 'trailingOnly' argument to be used in
	conjunction with --args.

    o	contour() now passes graphical parameters in '...' to axis()
	and box().

    o	New data set 'crimtab' on Student(1908)'s 3000 criminals.

    o	cut.default() has a new argument 'ordered_result'.

    o	.deparseOpts() has two new options: "keepNA" to ensure that
	different types (logical, integer, double, character and
	complex) of NAs are distinguished, and "S_compatible" to
	suppress the use of R-specific features such as 123L and to
	deparse integer values of a double vector with a trailing
	decimal point.

	The 'keepInteger' option now uses the suffix 'L' rather than
	as.integer() where possible (unless all entries are NA or
	"S_compatible" is also set).

	Other deparse options can now be added to "all" (which has not
	for some time actually switched on all options).

	Integer sequences m:n are now deparsed in that form.

    o	deparse() and dput() now include "keepInteger" and "keepNA" in
	their defaults for the 'control' argument.

    o   detach() now takes another argument, unload, which indicates
        whether or not to unload the package and then only cleans
        up the S4 methods if the package successfully unloads.

    o	There are new constants NA_integer_, NA_real_, NA_complex_ and
	NA_character_ to denote NAs of those types, and they will be
	used in deparsing in place of as.integer(NA) etc unless
	.deparseOpts() includes "S_compatible".

    o	dev.print() now recognizes 'screen devices' as all those with
	an enabled display list, rather than a hard-coded set.

    o	Objects of class "difftime" are now handled more flexibly. The
	units of such objects can now be accessed via a units()
	function, which also has a replacement form, and there are
	conversion methods to and from numeric, which also allow the
	specification of units.	 Objects of this class can also be
	stored in data frames now.  A format() method has been added,
	and the print method was revised.

    o	New function environmentName() to give the print name of
	environments such as "namespace:base".
	This is now used by str().

    o	New function env.profile() provides R level access to summary
	statistics on environments.  In a related patch, new.env()
	now allows the user to specify an initial size for a hashed
	environment.

    o	file() can read the X11 clipboard selection as "X11_clipboard"
	on suitable X11-using systems.

    o	file("stdin") is now recognized, and refers to the process's
	'stdin' file stream whereas stdin() refers to the console.
	These may differ, for example for a GUI console, an embedded
	application of R or if --file= has been used.

    o	file_test() is now also available in package utils.
	(It is now private in package tools.)

    o	file.show() gains an 'encoding' argument.

    o	New functions formatUL() and formatOL() in package utils for
	formatting unordered (itemize) and ordered (enumerate) lists.

    o	The statistics reported when gcinfo(TRUE) are now of the amounts
	used (in Mb) and not of the amounts free (which are not really
	relevant when there are no hard limits, only gc trigger points).

    o	New function get_all_vars() to retrieve all the
	(untransformed) variables that the default method of
	model.frame() would use to create the model frame.

    o	interaction() has a new argument 'lex.order'.

    o   initialize() (in methods) now tries to be smarter about
        updating the new instance in place, thereby reducing
        copying.

    o	install.packages(dependencies = NA) is a new default, which is
	to install essential dependencies when installing from
	repositories to a single library.  As a result of this change,
	update.packages() will install any new dependencies of the
	packages it is updating (alongside the package in the same
	library tree).

	If 'lib' is not specified or is specified of length one and
	the chosen location is not a writable directory,
	install.packages() offers to create a personal library
	directory for you if one does not already exist, and to
	install there.

    o	is.atomic, is.call, is.character, is.complex, is.double (== is.real),
	is.environment, is.expression, is.function, is.integer,
	is.list, is.logical, is.null, is.object, is.pairlist,
	is.recursive, is.single and is.symbol (== is.name) are no
	longer internally S3 generic, nor can S4 methods be written
	for them.

	The "factor" methods of is.integer and is.numeric have been
	replaced by internal code.

    o	Added is.raw() for completeness.

    o	l10n_info() also reports if the current locale is Latin-1.

    o	levels<-(), names() and names<-() now dispatch internally for
	efficiency and so no longer have S3 default methods.

    o	.libPaths() now does both tilde and glob expansion.

    o	Functions lm(), glm() loess(), xtabs() and the default method
	of model.frame() coerce their 'formula'	argument (if supplied)
	to a formula.

    o	max(), min() and range() now work with character vectors.

    o	message() has a new argument 'appendLF' to handle messages
	with and without newlines.  There is a new message class
	packageStartupMessage() that can be suppressed separately.

    o	A new function, method.skeleton() writes a skeleton version of
        a call to setMethod() to a file, with correct arguments and
        format, given the name of the function and the method signature.

    o	mode<- and storage.mode<- do slightly less copying.

    o	nls.control(* , printEval = FALSE, warnOnly = FALSE) are two new
	options to help better analyze (non-)convergence of nls(),
	thanks to Kate Mullen.

	nls() and summary(nls()) now contain more information and also
	print information about convergence.

    o	options(device = ) now accepts a function object as well as
	the name of a function.

    o	pdf() supports new values for 'paper' of "US" (same as
	"letter"), "a4r" and "USr" (the latter two meaning rotated to
	landscape).  postscript() also accepts paper = "US".

    o	persp() now respects the graphical pars 'cex.axis', 'cex.lab',
	'font.axis' and 'font.lab'.

    o	New faster internal functions pmax.int() and pmin.int() for
	inputs which are atomic vectors without classes (called by
	pmax/pmin where applicable).

	pmin/pmax are now more likely to work with classed objects:
	they work with POSIXlt datetimes, for example.

    o	postscript() now by default writes grey colors (including black
	and white) via 'setgray', which gives more widely acceptable
	output.	 There are options to write pure RGB, CMYK or gray via
	the new argument 'colormodel'.

    o	rbind.data.frame() now ignores all zero-row inputs, as well as
	zero-column inputs (which it used to do, undocumented).	 This
	is because read.table() can create zero-row data frames with
	NULL columns, and those cannot be extended.

    o	readChar() and writeChar() can now work with a raw vector.

    o	read.table(), write.table() and allies have been moved to package
	utils.

    o	rgb() now accepts the red, green and blue components in a
	single matrix or data frame.

    o	New utility function RShowDoc() in package 'utils' to find and
	display manuals and other documentation files.

    o	New .row_names_info() utility function finds the number of rows
	efficiently for data frames; consequently, dim.data.frame()
	has become very fast for large data frames with 'automatic'
	row names.

    o	RSiteSearch() now also allows to search postings of the 'R-devel'
	mailing list.

    o	screeplot() is now (S3) generic with a default method, thanks
	to a patch from Gavin Simpson.

    o	Experimental 'verbose' argument for selectMethod().  Might be
	replaced later by a better interface for method selection
	inspection.

    o	Added links to source files to the parsing routines, so that
	source() can now echo the original source and comments (rather
	than deparsing).  This affects example() and Sweave() as well.

    o	stack() and unstack() have been moved to package utils.

    o	strptime() now sets the "tzone" attribute on the result if
	tz != "".

    o	str.default() typically prints fewer entries of logical vectors.

    o	The RweaveLatex driver for Sweave() now supports two new
	options: expand=FALSE, to show chunk references in the output,
	and concordance=TRUE, to output the concordance between input
	and output lines.

    o	system() now takes the same set of arguments on all platforms,
	with those which are not applicable being ignored with a
	warning.  Unix-alikes gain 'input' and 'wait', and Windows
	gains 'ignore.stderr'.

    o	system.time() and proc.time() now return an object of class
	"proc_time" with a print() method that returns a POSIX-like
	format with names.

    o	Sys.getenv() has a new argument 'unset' to allow unset and set
	to "" to be distinguished (if the OS does).  The results of
	Sys.getenv() are now sorted (by name).

    o	New function Sys.glob(), a wrapper for the POSIX.2 function
	glob(3) to do wildcard expansion (on systems which have it,
	plus an emulation on Windows).

    o	Sys.setenv() is a new (and preferred) synonym for Sys.putenv().
	The internal C code uses the POSIX-preferred 'setenv' rather
	than 'putenv' where the former is available.

    o	New function Sys.unsetenv() to remove environment variables
	(on systems where unsetenv is implemented or putenv can remove
	variables, such as on Windows).

    o	text(), mtext(), strheight(), strwidth(), legend(), axis(),
	title(), pie(), grid.text() and textGrob() all attempt to
	coerce non-language annotation objects (in the sense of is.object)
	to character vectors.  This is principally intended to cover
	factors and POSIXt and Date objects, and is done via the
	new utility function as.graphicsAnnot() in package grDevices.

    o	tcltk:tk_select.list() now chooses the width to fit the widest item.

    o	{re,un}tracemem() are now primitives for efficiency and so
	migrate from 'utils' to 'base'.

    o	union(), interect(), setdiff() and setequal() now coerce their
	arguments to be vectors (and they were documented only to
	apply to vectors).

    o	uniroot() now works if the zero occurs at one of the ends of
	the interval (suggestion of Tamas Papp).

    o	There is a new function View() for viewing matrix-like
	objects in a spreadsheet, which can be left up whilst R is
	running.

    o	New function withVisible() allows R level access to the
	visibility flag.

    o	zip.file.extract() has been moved to package utils.


    o	A few more cases of subassignment work, e.g. <raw>[] <- <list>
	and <vector>[] <- <expression>, with suitable coercion of the LHS.

    o	There is a warning if \ is used unnecessarily in a string when
	being parsed, e.g. "\." where probably "\\." was intended.
	("\." is valid, but the same as ".".)  Thanks to Bill Dunlap
	for the suggestion.

    o	Introduced the suffix L for integer literals to create
	integer rather than numeric values, e.g. 100L, 0x10L, 1e2L.

    o	Set the parser to give verbose error messages in case of
	syntax errors.

    o	The class "LinearMethodsList" has been extended and will be
	used to create list versions of methods, derived from the
	methods tables (environments).	The older recursive
	"MethodsList" class will be deprecated (by the release of
	2.5.0 if possible).

    o	There are more flexible ways to specify the default library
	search path.  In addition to R_LIBS and .Library, there are
	.Library.site (defaults to R_HOME/site-library) and
	R_LIBS_USER (defaults to a platform- and version-specific
	directory in ~/R).  See ?.libPaths for details.

    o	LAPACK has been updated to version 3.1.0.  This should cause
	only small changes to the output, but do remember that the sign
	of eigenvectors (and principal components) is indeterminate.

    o	PCRE has been updated to version 7.0.

    o	Several functions handle row names more efficiently:

	- read.table() and read.DIF() make use of integer row names
	  where appropriate, and avoid at least one copy in assigning
	  them.

	- data.frame() and the standard as.data.frame() methods avoid
	  generating long dummy row names and then discarding them.

	- expand.grid() and merge() generate compact 'automatic' row
	  names.

	- data.matrix() and as.matrix.data.frame() have a new argument
	  'rownames.force' that by default drops 'automatic' row names.

    o	<data frame>[i, j] is substantially more memory-efficient when
	only a small part of the data frame is selected, especially
	when (part of) a single column is selected.

    o	Command-line R (and Rterm.exe under Windows) accepts the options
	'-f filename', '--file=filename' and '-e expression' to follow
	other script interpreters.  These imply --no-save unless
	--save is specified.

    o	Invalid bytes in character strings in an MBCS now deparse/print
	in the form "\xc1" rather than "<c1>", which means they can be
	parsed/scanned.

    o	Printing functions (without source attributes) and expressions
	now preserves integers (using the L suffix) and NAs (using
	NA_real_ etc where necessary).

    o	The 'internal' objects .helpForCall, .tryHelp and topicName are
	no longer exported from 'utils'.

    o	The internal regex code has been upgraded to glibc 2.5 (from 2.3.6).

    o	Text help now attempts to display files which have an \encoding
	section in the specified encoding via file.show().

    o	R now attempts to keep track of character strings which are
	known to be in Latin-1 or UTF-8 and print or plot them
	appropriately in other locales.	 This is primarily intended
	to make it possible to use data in Western European languages
	in both Latin-1 and UTF-8 locales.  Currently scan(),
	read.table(), readLines(), parse() and source() allow
	encodings to be declared, and console input in suitable
	locales is also recognized.

	New function Encoding() can read or set the declared encodings
	for a character vector.

    o	There have been numerous performance improvements to the data
	editor on both Windows and X11.	 In particular, resizing the
	window works much better on X11.

    o	Packages graphics and grid no longer require grDevices, as
	they might be used only with third-party devices.


DEPRECATED & DEFUNCT

    o	symbol.C() and symbol.For() are defunct, and have been replaced
	by wrappers that give a warning.

    o	Calling a builtin function with an empty argument is now always
	an error.

    o	The autoloading of ts() is defunct.

    o	The undocumented reserved word GLOBAL.ENV has been removed.
	(It was yet another way to get the value of the symbol
	.GlobalEnv.)

    o	The deprecated behaviour of structure() in adding a class when
	specifying with "tsp" or "levels" attributes is now defunct.

    o	unix() is now finally defunct, having been deprecated for
	at least seven years.

    o	Sys.putenv() is now deprecated in favour of Sys.setenv(),
	following the POSIX recommendation.

    o	Building R with --without-iconv is deprecated.

    o	Using $ on an atomic vector is deprecated (it was previously
	valid and documented to return NULL).

    o	The use of storage.mode<- for other than standard types (and
        in particular for value "single") is deprecated: use mode<-
	instead.


INSTALLATION

    o	A suitable iconv (e.g. from glibc or GNU libiconv) is
	required.  For 2.5.x only you can build R without it by
	configuring using --without-iconv.

    o	There is support again for building on AIX (tested on 5.2 and 5.3)
	thanks to Ei-ji Nakama.

    o	Autoconf 2.60 or later is used to create 'configure'.  This
	makes a number of small changes, and incorporates the changes
	to the detection of a C99-compliant C compiler backported for
	2.4.1.

    o	Detection of a Java development environment was added such that
	packages don't need to provide their own Java detection. Newly
	added make variables are JAVAC, JAVAH, JAR and JAVA_CPPFLAGS.

	R CMD javareconf was updated to look for the corresponding
	Java tools as well.

	In addition, Java detection honors user-supplied environment
	variables JAVA_CPPFLAGS, JAVA_LIBS and JAVA_LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

    o	Added workaround for reported non-POSIX sh on OSF1.  (PR#9375)

    o	'make install-strip' now works, stripping the executables and
	also the shared libraries and modules on platforms where
	'libtool' knows how to do so.

    o	Building R as a shared library and standalone nmath now
	installs pkg-config files 'libR.pc' and 'libRmath.pc' respectively.

    o	Added test for insufficiently complete implementation of sigaction.


C-LEVEL FACILITIES

    o	Functions str2type, type2char and type2str are now available in
	Rinternals.h.

    o	Added support for Objective C in R and packages (if available).

    o	R_ParseVector() has a new 4th argument 'SEXP srcfile' allowing
	source references to be attached to the returned expression list.

    o	Added ptr_R_WriteConsoleEx callback which allows consoles to
	distinguish between regular output and errors/warnings.
	To ensure backward compatibility it is only used if
	ptr_R_WriteConsole is set to NULL.


UTILITIES

    o	Additional Sweave() internal functions are exported to help
	writing new drivers, and RweaveLatexRuncode() is now created
	using a helper function (all from a patch submitted by Seth
	Falcon).

    o	The following additional flags are accessible from R CMD config:
	OBJC, OBJCFLAGS, JAR, JAVA, JAVAC, JAVAH, JAVA_HOME, JAVA_LIBS
	and JAVA_CPPFLAGS.

    o	R CMD build now takes the package name from the DESCRIPTION
	file and not from the directory.  (PR#9266)

    o	checkS3methods() (and hence R CMD check) now checks agreement
	with primitive internal generics, and checks for additional
	arguments in methods where the generic does not have a '...'
	argument.

	codoc() now knows the argument lists of primitive functions.

    o	R CMD INSTALL and R CMD REMOVE now use as the default library
	(if -l is not specified) the first library that would be used
	if R were run in the current environment (and they run R to
	find it).

    o	There is a new front-end Rscript which can be used for #!
	scripts and similar tasks.  See help("Rscript") and 'An
	Introduction to R' for further details.

    o	R CMD BATCH (not Windows) no longer prepends
	'invisible(options(echo = TRUE))' to the input script.  This
	was the default unless --slave is specified and the latter is
	no longer overridden.

	On all OSes it makes use of the -f argument to R, so
	file("stdin") can be used from BATCH scripts.

	On all OSes it reports proc.time() at the end of the script
	unless q() is called with options to inhibit this.

    o	R CMD INSTALL now prepends the installation directory (if
	specified) to the library search path.

    o	Package installation now re-encodes R files and the NAMESPACE
	file if the DESCRIPTION file specifies an encoding, and sets
	the encoding used for reading files in preparing for
	LazyData.  This will help if a package needs to be used in
	(say) both latin1 and UTF-8 locales on different systems.

    o	R CMD check now reports on non-ASCII strings in datasets.
	(These are a portability issue, which can be alleviated by
	marking their encoding: see 'Writing R Extensions'.)

    o	Rdiff now converts CRLF endings in the target file, and
	converts UTF-8 single quotes in either to ASCII quotes.

    o	New recommended package 'codetools' by Luke Tierney provides
	code-analysis tools.  This can optionally be used by 'R CMD
	check' to detect problems, especially symbols which are not
	visible.

    o	R CMD config now knows about LIBnn .

    o	New recommended package 'rcompgen' by Deepayan Sarkar
	provides support for command-line completion under the Unix
	terminal interface (provided readline is enabled) and the
	Windows Rgui and Rterm front ends.


BUG FIXES

    o	gc() can now report quantities of 'Vcells' in excess of 16Gb on
	64-bit systems (rather than reporting NA).

    o	Assigning class "factor" to an object now requires it has
	integer (and not say double) codes.

    o	structure() ensures that objects with added class "factor" have
	integer codes.

    o	The "formula" and "outer" attributes of datasets 'ChickWeight',
	'CO2', 'DNase', 'Indometh', 'Loblolly', 'Orange' and 'Theoph'
	now have an empty environment and not the environment used to
	dump the datasets in the package.

    o	Dataset 'Seatbelts' now correctly has class c("mts", "ts").

    o	str() now labels classes on data frames more coherently.

    o	Several 'special' primitives and .Internals could return
	invisibly if the evaluation of an argument led to the
	visibility flag being turned off.  These included
	as.character(), as.vector(), call(), dim(), dimnames(),
	lapply(), rep(), seq() and seq_along().  Others (e.g. dput()
	and print.default()) could return visibly when this was not
	intended.

    o	Several primitives such as dim() were not checking the number
	of arguments supplied before method dispatch.

    o	Tracing of primitive functions has been corrected.  It should
	now be the case that tracing either works or is not allowed
	for all primitive functions. (Problems remain if you make a
	primitive into a generic when it is being traced.  To be fixed
	later.)

    o	max.col() now omits infinite values in determining the
	relative tolerance.

    o	R CMD Sweave and R CMD Stangle now respond to --help and --version
	like other utilities.

    o	.libPaths() adds only existing directories (as it was
	documented to, but could add non-directories).

    o	setIs() and setClassUnion() failed to find some existing
	subclasses and produced spurious warnings, now fixed.

    o	data.frame() ignored 'row.names' for 0-column data frames, and
	no longer treats an explicit row.names=NULL differently from
	the default value.

    o	identical() looked at the internal structure of the
	'row.names' attribute, and not the value visible at R level.

    o	abline(reg) now also correctly works with intercept-only lm
	models, and abline() warns more when it's called illogically.

    o	warning() was truncating messages at
	getOption("warning.length") - 1 (not as documented), with no
	indication.  It now appends '[... truncated]'.

    o	Stangle/Sweave were throwing spurious warnings if options
	'result' or 'strip.white' were unset.

    o	all.equal() was ignoring 'check.attributes' for list and
	expression targets, and checking only attributes on raw vectors.
	Logical vectors were being compared as if they were numeric,
	(with a mean difference being quoted).

    o	Calculating the number of significant digits in a number was
	itself subject to rounding errors for digits >= 16.  The
	calculation has been changed to err on the side of slightly
	too few significant digits (but still at least 15) rather than
	far too many.  (An example is print(1.001, digits=16).)

    o	unlink() on Unix-alikes failed for paths containing spaces.

    o	substr() and friends treated NA 'start' or 'stop' incorrectly.

    o	merge(x, y, all.y = TRUE) would sometimes incorrectly return
	logical columns for columns only in y when there were no
	common rows.

    o	read.table(fn, col.names=) on an empty file returned NULL
	columns, rather than logical(0) columns (which is what results
	from reading a file with just a header).

    o	grid.[xy]axis(label=logical(0)) failed.

    o	expression() was unnecessarily duplicating arguments.

    o	as.expression(<list>) returned a single-element expression
	vector, which was not compatible with S: it now copies lists
	element-by-element.

    o	supsmu(periodic = TRUE) could segfault.  (PR#9502, detection
	and patch by Bill Dunlap.)

    o	pmax/pmin called with only logical arguments did not coerce to
	numeric, although they were documented to do so (as max/min
	do).

    o	methods() did not know that cbind() and rbind() are internally
	generic.

    o	dim(x) <- NULL removed the names of x, but this was always
	undocumented.  It is not clear that it is desirable but it is
	S-compatible and relied on, so is now documented.

    o	which(x, arr.ind = TRUE) did not return a matrix (as
	documented) if 'x' was an array of length 0.

    o	C-level duplicate() truncated CHARSXPs with embedded nuls.

    o	Partial matching of attributes was not working as documented
	in some cases if there were more than two partial matches or
	if "names" was involved.

    o	data(package=character(0)) was not looking in ./data as
	documented.

    o	summary.mlm() failed if some response names were "" (as can
	easily happen if cbind() is used).

    o	The postscript() and pdf() drivers shared an encoding list
	but used slightly different formats.  This caused problems if
	both were used with the same non-default encoding in the same
	session.  (PR#9517)

    o	The data editor was not allowing Inf, NA and NaN to be entered
	in numerical columns.  It was intended to differentiate
	between empty cells and NAs, but did not do so: it now does
	so for strings.

    o	supsmu() could segfault if all cases had non-finite values.
	(PR#9519)

    o	plnorm(x, lower.tail=FALSE) was returning the wrong tail for
	x <= 0.  (PR#9520)

    o	which.min() would not report a minimum of +Inf, and
	analogously for which.max().  (PR#9522)

    o	'R CMD check' could fail with an unhelpful error when checking
	Rd files for errors if there was only one file and that had a
	serious error.  (PR#9459)

    o	try() has been reimplemented using tryCatch() to solve two
	problems with the original implementation: (i) try() would run
	non-NULL options("error") expressions for errors within a try, and
	(ii) try() would catch user interrupts.

    o	str(obj) could fail when obj contained a dendrogram.

    o	Using <data frame>[, <last column>] <- NULL failed (PR#9565)

    o	choose(n, k) could return non-integer values for integer n and
	small k on some platforms.

    o	nclass.scott(x) and nclass.FD(x) no longer return NaN when var(x)
	or IQR(x) (respectively) is zero.

	hist() now allows breaks = 1 (which the above patch will
	return), but not breaks = Inf (which gave an obscure error).

    o	strptime("%j") now also works for the first days of Feb-Dec.
	(PR#9577)

    o	write.table() now recovers better if 'file' is an unopened
	connection.  (It used to open it for both the column names and
	the data.)

    o	Fixed bug in mosaicplot(sort=) introduced by undocumented
	change in R 2.4.1 (changeset r39655).

    o	contr.treatment(n=0) failed with a spurious error message.
	(It remains an error.)

    o	as.numeric() was incorrectly documented: it is identical to
	as.double.

    o	jitter(rep(-1, 3)) gave NaNs. (PR#9580)

    o	max.col() was not random for a row of zeroes. (PR#9542)

    o	ansari.test(conf.int=TRUE, exact=FALSE) failed.

    o	trace() now works on S3 registered methods, by modifying the
	version in the S3 methods table.

    o	rep(length=1, each=0) segfaulted.

    o	postscript() could overflow a buffer if used with a long
	'command' argument.

    o	The internal computations to copy complete attribute lists did
	not copy the flag marking S4 objects, so the copies no longer
	behaved like S4 objects.

    o	The C code of nlminb() was altering a variable without
	duplicating it.  (This did not affect nlminb() but would have
	if the code was called from a different wrapper.)

    o	smooth(kind = "3RS3R") (the current default) used .C(DUP =
	FALSE) but altered its input argument.  (This was masked by
	duplication in as.double.)

    o	The signature for the predefined S4 method for as.character()
	was missing '...' .

    o	readBin(<raw vector>) could read beyond the end of the vector
	when size-changing was involved.

    o	The C entry point PrintValue (designed to emulate auto-printing)
	would not find show() for use on S4 objects, and did not have
	the same search path (for show(), print() and print() methods)
	as auto-printing.  Also, auto-printing and print() of S4
	objects would fail to find 'show' if the methods namespace was
	loaded but the package was not attached (or otherwise not in
	the search path).

    o	print() (and auto-printing) now recognize S4 objects even when
	'methods' is not loaded, and print a short summary rather than
	dump the internal structure.

    o	Sweave and Stangle had problems due to partial matching of code
	chunk names when run with split=TRUE.

    o	install.packages() on a source package now ensures that
	R CMD INSTALL sees the same library search path as
	install.packages() did when computing dependencies.

    o	density() now ensures its 'y' values are non-negative. (PR#8876)

    o	is.finite() and is.infinite() (and many other primitives)
	are not internally generic and so do not support S4 methods,
	which can no longer be set. (PR#7951)

    o	nls(algorithm = "port") now accepts a list 'start' argument,
	as for the other methods (and as documented).

    o	Standard errors from the "ar" method of predict() could be
	wrong for the last p predictions for models near
	non-stationarity. (PR#9614)

		CHANGES IN R VERSION 2.4.1 patched

NEW FEATURES

    o	The Simplified Chinese translations have been completed.


BUG FIXES

    o	co.intervals() sometimes failed to cover the largest value.

    o	tempfile() is now random across sessions as well as within a
	session.  (On some systems it would give the same hex suffix
	at the start of each session.)

    o	Added infinite recursion test to internal function isMissing.
	(PR#9426)

    o	The "Date" and "POSIXt" methods for cut() were not choosing
	the first day of the year for breaks = "years".
	(In part, PR#9433.)

    o	R is now able to deparse/print invalid multibyte strings in
	MBCS locales (such as UTF-8) using hex escapes.  This means
	that e.g. demo(Hershey) works in all such locales.

    o	optimize() could give incorrect answers in some rare problems
	with exact symmetry about the midpoint of the interval
	supplied.  (PR#9438)

    o	The residuals from an lm() fit with no coefficients but an
	offset were incorrect.

    o	oneway.test() was expecting a literal formula and did not
	accept a variable containing a formula.

    o	The legacy Quartz device (used by console R) displayed its
	window outside the screen estate in some dual-head setups.
	Now it will be always displayed in the center of the main
	screen.

    o	read.ftable() was not functional on non-seekable connections
	such as URLs.

    o	Some large memory allocations could cause segfaults or
	crashes (e.g. followup to PR#9557).

    o	Sweave() would drop characters from the end of chunk names
    	ending in "R".  (PR#9567)

    o	library(), i.e. its internal checkConflicts(), now (again) prints
	"The following object(s) are masked .." only once per masked package.

    o	methods:::cbind(x) {one argument} now works, calling cbind2(x)
	when 'x' is an S4 object.



		CHANGES IN R VERSION 2.4.1


INSTALLATION

    o	The extraction of info from Subversion for an SVN checkout now
	also works for svn >= 1.4.0.  However, on Windows the 'Last
	Changed Date' will be in the local timezone, and not in GMT as
	previously.

    o	configure uses code borrowed from autoconf 2.60 to try harder to
	ensure that a C99-compliant compiler is used.  (It does so by
	appending to CC.)  This avoids problems with systems such as FC5
	which override CFLAGS and thereby lose flags such as -std=gnu99.


NEW FEATURES

    o	rainbow(), heat.colors(), terrain.colors(), topo.colors() and
	cm.colors() all gain an 'alpha' argument to be passed to hsv().

    o	dput() will give an incorrect representation of the row names
	of a data frame with integer row names.  This is now corrected
	when the object is recreated.


C-LEVEL FACILITIES

    o	Using STRICT_R_HEADERS applies to more reported clashes with
	Windows headers, including Calloc and Realloc.  These and
	Free need to be prefixed by R_ when STRICT_R_HEADERS is defined.


DEPRECATED & DEFUNCT

    o	The previously undocumented behaviour of structure() in adding a
	class when specifying "tsp" or "levels" attributes is now
	deprecated (with a warning).


BUG FIXES

    o	Fixed warning() to use .dfltWarn intead of .dfltStop for default
	handling (PR#9274).

    o	R would slow down when the product of the length of a vector and
	the length of a character vector used to subset it exceeded 2^31.
	(PR#9280)

    o	merge() now allows zero-row data frames.

    o	add1.lm() had been broken by other changes for weighted fits.

    o	axis.POSIXct() would sometimes give the wrong labels.

    o	Help for a method call would fail. (PR#9291)

    o	gzfile() returned an object of class "file" not "gzfile". (PR#9271)

    o	load()ing from a connection had a logic bug in when it closed
	the connection. (PR#9271)

    o	The lowess() algorithm is unstable if the MAD of the residuals
	becomes (effectively) zero: R now terminates the iterations at
	that point.  (This may result in quite different answers.)

	The 'delta' argument was incorrectly documented.  (PR#9264)

    o	abbreviate() would only work for strings of up to 8191 bytes,
	but this was not checked.  Now longer strings are errors.

    o	Drawing X11 rotated text was buggy for VERY small (negative)
	angle of rotation.  Reported by Ben Bolker. (PR#9301)

    o	The X11 data editor would crash in an MBCS locale if R was
	compiled with FC's CFLAGS that add buffer overflow and
	stack-smashing detection.

    o	rect() was not accepting border=NA in some cases involving
	cross-hatching.

    o	Fixes to S4 group generics to ensure that the correct number of
	active arguments are in the signature of the group and all
	members.  Also a fix to keep the 'groupMembers' slot up to date.

    o	S4 group generic "Logic" (with '&', '|', but not '!') has been
	created, following the green book (apart from '!').

    o	removeClass() now takes care to remove any subclass references
	to the deleted class.

    o	mle() (in stats4) might not have worked as intended when the
	order of parameters in 'start' differed from that in the
	log-likelihood.	 (PR#9313)

    o	dotchart() now properly restores par() settings after itself.

    o	system() on Mac OS X was blocking arbitrary signals during the
	call although only SIGPROF was meant to be blocked.

    o	methods cached via callNextMethod() and (sometimes) as() were
	being cached as directly specified although in fact they were
	inherited.  Caused problems in later search for inherited methods.

    o	str() works properly for method definitions and other S4-classed
	function objects.

    o	JAVA_LIBS are now set correctly on MacOS X.

    o	Fix null-termination issue suspected of causing crash with Fedora
	Extra RPMS (PR#9339, Justin Harrington, analysis and fix from Bill
	Dunlap).

    o	Namespaces restored via a saved session silently failed to cache
	their methods because the methods package was not yet
	attached.  Fixed by attaching methods before restoring data.

    o	rbind()ing a list to a data frame generated invalid row names,
	which were an error in 2.4.0. (PR#9346)

    o	boxplot.stats(x) now returns the correct minimum instead of an
	error for x <- c(1,Inf,Inf,Inf), and hence boxplot(x) "works".

    o	promptClass() now uses \linkS4class{<ClassName>} instead of
	of \link{<ClassName>-class}.

    o	gc() no longer reports nonsense values for the number of used
	Vcells if the true value exceeds 2^31 (and hence over 16Gb of
	heap is in use): it now reports NA. (PR#9345)

    o	rapply() now detects more user errors in supplying arguments. (PR#9349)

    o	boxplot() was ignoring argument 'boxfill'. (PR#9352)

    o	plot.lm(which = 6, id.n = 0) did not work. (PR#9333)

    o	.deparseOpts("delayPromises") was not matching the C code,
	returning 64 rather than 32.

    o	bxp() could use partial matching on 'pars' when finding
	defaults for some of its parameters, e.g. a setting of 'cex.axis'
	in 'pars' or inline was used to set a default for 'outcex'.

    o	acf() now allows lag.max = 0 except when type="partial", and
	forces the lag 0 autocorrelation to 1. (PR#9360)

    o	hist(*, include.lowest=., right=., plot=FALSE) does not warn
	anymore, (PR#9356) and more.

    o	Some bugs in caching superclass/subclass relations and in
	removing those relations on detach and on removeClass() have
	been fixed.

    o	readBin() could return one too many strings if 'n' was an
	over-estimate. (PR#9361)

    o	A request for an opaque colour in the pdf() device after a
	translucent one did not set the transparency back to opaque in
	2.4.0.

	Semi-transparent background colours were not being plotted on
	the pdf() device.

    o	plot.lm(which=5) in the case of constant leverage re-ordered
	the factor levels but not the residuals, so the labelling by
	factor level was often incorrect.

    o	packBits() was not accepting a logical argument. (PR#9374)

    o	make install was omitting doc/FAQ and doc/RESOURCES.

    o	A two-sample t.test(x, y, var.equal=TRUE) did not allow one of the
	groups to be of size one.

    o	The "ts" method for print() failed on some corrupted objects
	of class "ts", e.g. those without a "tsp" attribute.

    o	structure() reordered the "class" value given if there was a
	"tsp" value specified.

    o	pairs() now does pass appropriate parts of '...' to the
	'diag.panel' argument. (PR#9384)

    o	plot.lm() was using an incorrect estimate of dispersion for
	some GLMs (including family=binomial and family=poisson).
	(PR#9316)

    o	Subsetting operators were setting R_Visible too early, so
	assignments in arguments could make the result invisible.
	(PR#9263)

    o   The tk-GUI was displaying a warning due to an extra comma in
        the list of manuals (PR#9396)

    o	packageDescription() now gives an explicit error on a corrupt
	DESCRIPTION file.

    o   There was a scoping issue with tcltk callbacks given as
        unevaluated expressions. This has only been partially fixed, a
        complete fix probably requires redesign.

    o	trace() had its return value documented incorrectly and was
	sometimes visible when it should not have been.

    o	pchisq() would sometimes use the wrong tail when calculating
	non-central probabilities with lower.tail = FALSE. (PR#9406)

    o	rm() could remove the wrong objects when passed an expression.
	(PR#9399)  Now only names are allowed in the '...' argument,
	and the incorrect documentation of what happened with
	character objects is corrected.

    o	url() was not supporting 'encoding' except on file:// URLs.



		CHANGES IN R VERSION 2.4.0


USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o	The startup message now prints first the version string and
	then the copyright notice (to be more similar to R --version).

    o	save() by default evaluates promise objects.  The old behaviour
	(to save the promise and its evaluation environment) can be
	obtained by setting the new argument 'eval.promises' to FALSE.
	(Note that this does not apply to promises embedded in
	objects, only to top-level objects.)

    o	The functions read.csv(), read.csv2(), read.delim(),
	read.delim2() now default their 'comment.char' argument to "".
	(These functions are designed to read files produced by other
	software, which might use the # character inside fields, but
	are unlikely to use it for comments.)

    o	The bindings in the base environment/namespace (currently the
	same thing) are now locked.  This means that the values of
	base functions cannot be changed except via
	assignInNamespace() and similar tricks.

    o	[[ on a factor now returns a one-element factor (and not an
	integer), as.list() on a factor returns a list of one-element
	factors (and not of character vectors), and unlist() on a list
	of factors returns a factor (and not an integer vector).
	These changes may affect the results of sapply() and lapply()
	applied to factors.

    o	mauchly.test() now returns the W statistic (for comparability
	with SAS and SPSS), rather than the z (which was accidentally
	not named in the output)

    o	sort(x, decreasing = FALSE, ...) is now a generic function.
	This means that 'partial' is no longer the second argument,
	and calls which used positional matching may be incorrect: we
	try to detect them.

    o	See the section on 'Changes to S4 methods': all packages
	depending on 'methods' need to be re-installed.


NEW FEATURES

    o	agrep(), grep(), strwrap(), strtrim(), substr() and
	related functions now coerce arguments which should be
	character via as.character() rather than internally (so method
	dispatch takes place, e.g. for factors).

	chartr(), charfold(), tolower() and toupper() now coerce their
	main argument if necessary to a character vector via
	as.character().

	Functions which work element-by-element on character vectors
	to give a character result now preserve attributes including
	names, dims and dimnames (as suggested by the Blue Book
	p. 144).  Such functions include charfold(), chartr(), gsub(),
	strtrim(), sub(), substr(), tolower() and toupper().  (Note
	that coercion of a non-character argument may lose the
	attributes.)

	agrep(value = TRUE) preserves names for compatibility with
	grep().

	nchar() has always preserved dims/dimnames (undocumented
	before) and now also preserves names.


    o	.Deprecated and .Defunct take a new parameter, msg, that allows
	for the specification of the message printed and facilitates
	deprecation of calling sequences etc.

    o	.Fortran() will map 'name' to lower case, and will work with
	'name' containing underscores.

    o	The default is now .saveRDS(compress = TRUE)

    o	The :: operator now also works for packages without name spaces
	that are on the search path.

    o	[[ on a list does not duplicate the extracted element unless
	necessary.  (It did not duplicate in other cases, e.g. a
	pairlist.)

    o	argsAnywhere() works like args() on non-exported functions.

    o	as.data.frame() gains a '...' argument.

    o	Added an as.data.frame() method for class "ftable".

    o	as.list(<an expression>) is now handled by internal code and
	no longer loses attributes such as names.

	as.list(<a list>) no longer duplicates (unnecessarily).

    o	as.POSIX[cl]t can now convert character strings containing
	fractional seconds.

    o	attach() can now attach a copy of an environment.

    o	available.packages() and installed.packages() gain a 'fields'
	argument thanks to Seth Falcon.

    o	axis.POSIXct() uses a different algorithm for ranges of 2 to 50
	days that will mark days at midnight in the current timezone
	(even if the graph crosses a DST change).

    o	body<-() and formals<-() default to envir = environment(fun),
	that is they do not by default change the environment.
	(Previously they changed it to parent.frame().)

    o	New function combn(x, m, ..) for computing on all combinations of
	size 'm' (for small 'm' !).

    o	The cumxxx() functions now handle logical/integer arguments
	separately from numeric ones, and so return an integer result
	where appropriate.

    o	data.frame() has a new argument 'stringsAsFactor'.  This and
	the default for read.table(as.is=) are set from the new global
	option 'stringsAsFactors' via the utility function
	default.stringsAsFactors().

    o	dev.interactive() now has an optional argument 'orNone'.

    o	df() now has a noncentrality argument 'ncp', based on a
	contribution by Peter Ruckdeschel.

    o	example() gains an argument 'ask' which defaults to "TRUE when
	sensible", but the default can be overridden by setting option
	'example.ask'.

    o	expand.grid() now has an argument 'KEEP.OUT.ATTRS' which can
	suppress (the potentially expensive) "out.attrs" attribute. It no
	longer returns an extraneous 'colnames' attribute.

    o	The subset and subassign methods for factors now handle factor
	matrices, and dim() can be set on a factor.

    o	There is now a format() method for class "ftable".

    o	head(x, n) and tail(x, n) now also work for negative arguments,
	thanks to Vincent Goulet.

    o	head.matrix() and tail.matrix() are no longer hidden, to be used
	for building head() and tail() methods for other classes.

    o	If help() finds multiple help files for a given topic, a menu
	of titles is used to allow interactive choice.

    o	help.search() now rebuilds the database if 'package' specifies a
	package not in the saved database.

    o	hist(*, plot = FALSE) now warns about unused arguments.

    o	history() gains a 'pattern' argument as suggested by Romain
	Francois.

    o	integer(0) now prints as that rather than "numeric(0)" (it
	always deparsed as "integer(0)").

    o	interaction(..., drop=TRUE) now gives the same result as
	interaction(...)[,drop=TRUE] (it used to sometimes give a
	different order for the levels).

    o	lag.plot() produces a conventional plot (not setting mfrow) if
	only one plot is to be produced.

    o	lapply() does much less copying.  Vector X are handled without
	duplication, and other types are coerced via as.list().	 (As a
	result, package 'boot' runs its examples 4% faster.)

	lapply(<a pairlist>) now coerces to a list (rather than traverse
	the pairlist from the beginning for each item).

    o	legend() has new parameters 'box.lwd' and 'box.lty'.

    o	lines() gains a simple method for isoreg() results.

    o	load() no longer coerces pairlists to lists (which was
	undocumented, but has been happening since 1998).

    o	make.link() now returns an object of class "link-glm".
	The GLM families accept an object of this class for their
	'link' argument, which allows user-specified link functions.
	Also, quasi() allows user-specified variance functions.

    o	mapply() uses names more analogously to lapply(), e.g..

    o	matplot() now accepts a 'bg' argument similarly to plot.default() etc.

    o	median() is now generic, and its default method uses mean()
	rather than sum() and so is more widely applicable (e.g. to dates).

    o	Dummy functions memory.size() and memory.limit() are available
	on Unix-alikes, for people who have not noticed that documentation
	is Windows-specific.

    o	merge() works more efficiently when there are relatively few
	matches between the data frames (for example, for 1-1
	matching).  The order of the result is changed for 'sort = FALSE'.

    o	merge() now inserts row names as a character column and not a
	factor: this makes the default sort order more comprehensible.

    o	Raw, complex and character vectors are now allowed in model
	frames (there was a previously undocumented restriction to
	logical, integer and numeric types.).  Character vectors in a
	formula passed to model.matrix() are converted to factors and
	coded accordingly.

    o	modifyList() utility, typically for housekeeping nested lists.

    o	x <- 1:20; y <- rnorm(x); nls(y ~ A*exp(-x^2/sig)) no longer
	returns an unhelpful error message.  In this and similar cases, it
	now tries a wild guess for starting values.

    o	Ops.difftime() now handles unary minus and plus.

    o	Ops.Date() and Ops.POSIXt() now allow character arguments
	(which are coerced to the appropriate class before comparison,
	for Ops.POSIXt() using the current time zone).

    o	There is a new option(max.contour.segments = 25000) which can be
	raised to allow extremely complex contour lines in contour()
	and contourLines().  (PR#9205)

    o	options(max.print = N) where N defaults to 99999 now cuts printing
	of large objects after about N entries.	 print(x, ..., max = N)
	does the same for the default method and those building on
	print.default().

	options("menu.graphics") controls if graphical menus should be
	used when available.

	options("par.ask.default") allows the default for par("ask")
	to be set for a newly-opened device.  (Defaults to FALSE, the
	previous behaviour.)

	The way option("papersize") is set has been changed.  On
	platforms which support the LC_PAPER locale category, the
	setting is taken first from the R_PAPERSIZE environment
	variable at run time, then from the LC_PAPER category
	("letter" for _US and _CA locales and "a4" otherwise).	On
	other platforms (including Windows and older Unixen), the
	choice is unchanged.

    o	package.skeleton() gains arguments 'namespace' and
	'code_files'.

    o	par(ask=TRUE) now only applies to interactive R sessions.

    o	parse() now returns up to 'n' expressions, rather than fill
	the expressions vector with NULL.  (This is now compatible
	with S.)

    o	The 'version' argument for pdf() is now increased
	automatically (with a warning) if features which need a higher
	level are used.

    o	pie() now allows expressions for 'labels', and empty slices.

    o	There is a new '%.%' operator for mathematical annotations
	(plotmath) which draws a centred multiplication dot
	(a \cdot in LaTeX), thanks to Uwe Ligges.

    o	predict.lm() gains a 'pred.var' argument.  (Wishlist PR#8877.)

    o	print.summary.{aov,glm,lm,nls} and print.{aov,glm} make use of
	naprint() to report when na.action altered the model frame.

    o	print.table(T, zero.print=ch) now also replaces 0 by ch when T is
	non-integer with integer entries.

    o	Recursive rapply() which is similar to lapply but used
	recursively and can restrict the classes of elements to which
	it is applied.

    o	r2dtable() has been moved to package 'stats'.

    o	New function read.DIF() to read Data Interchange Format files,
	and (on Windows) this format from the clipboard.

    o	New experimental function readNEWS() to read R's own "NEWS" file
	and similarly formatted ones.

    o	readLines() has a new argument 'warn' to suppress warnings:
	the default behaviour is still to warn.

    o	reg.finalizer() has a new argument 'onexit' to parallel the
	C-level equivalent R_RegisterFinalizerEx.

    o	rep() is now a primitive function and under some conditions
	very much faster: rep.int() is still a little faster (but does
	less). (Because it is primitive there are minor changes to the
	call semantics: see the help page.)

    o	The 'row.names' of a data frame may be stored internally as an
	integer or character vector.  This can result in considerably
	more compact storage (and more logical row names from rbind)
	when the row.names are 1:nrow(x).  However, such data frames
	are not compatible with earlier versions of R: this can be
	ensured by supplying a character vector as 'row.names'.

	row.names() will always return a character vector, but direct
	access to the attribute may not.

	The internal storage of row.names = 1:n just records 'n', for
	efficiency with very long vectors.

	The "row.names" attribute must be a character or integer
	vector, and this is now enforced by the C code.

    o	The "data.frame" and "matrix" methods for rowsum() gain an 'na.rm'
	argument.

    o	Experimental support for memory-use profiling via Rprof(),
	summaryRprof(), Rprofmem() and tracemem().

    o	save.image() [also called by sys.save.image() and hence from q()]
	now defaults to saving compressed binary images.  To revert to
	the previous behaviour set option "save.image.defaults": see
	?save.image.

    o	There is a new primitive seq.int() which is slightly more
	restricted than seq() but often very much faster, and new
	primitives seq_along() and seq_len() which are faster still.

    o	serialize(connection = NULL) now returns a raw vector (and not
	a character string).  unserialize() accepts both old and new
	formats (and has since 2.3.0).

    o	setwd() now returns the previously current directory (invisibly).

    o	The function sort() is now sort.int(), with a new generic
	function sort() which behaves in the same way (except for the
	order of its argument list) for objects without a class, and
	relies on the '[' method for objects with a class (unless a
	specific method has been written, as it has for class "POSIXlt").

    o	sort.list() now implements complex vectors (PR#9039), and how
	complex numbers are sorted is now documented.

    o	spline() and splinefun() now follow approx[fun] to have an argument
	'ties = mean' which makes them applicable also when 'x' has
	duplicated values.

    o	str(x) does not print the S3 "class" attribute when it is the
	same as 'mode' (which is printed anyway, possibly abbreviated)
	and it puts it beside mode for atomic objects such as S3 class
	"table".

    o	str(<data.frame>) now outputs 'data.frame' instead of
	`data.frame'; this may affect some strict (Package) tests.

    o	str() now takes also its defaults for 'vec.len' and 'digits.d'
	from options('str') which can be set by the new strOptions().

    o	symnum() has a new argument 'numeric.x' particularly useful for
	handling 0/1 data.

    o	Sys.getlocale() and Sys.setlocale() support LC_MESSAGES,
	LC_PAPER and LC_MEASUREMENT if the platform does.

    o	Sweave has a new options 'pdf.encoding' and 'pdf.version' for
	its Rweave driver.

    o	The character vector used by an output textConnection() has
	a locked binding whilst the connection is open.

	There is a new function textConnectionValue() to retrieve the
	value of an output textConnection().

    o	traceback() gains a 'max.lines' argument.
	.Traceback is no longer stored in the workspace.

    o	warning(immediate. = TRUE) now applies to
	getOption("warn") < 0 and not just == 0.

    o	warnings() is now an accessor function for 'last.warning' (which
	is no longer stored in the workspace) with a print() method.


    o	The internal internet download functions have some new
	features from libxml 2.6.26.

    o	There is an option "HTTPUserAgent" to set the User Agent in R
	download requests etc.	Patch from S. Falcon.

    o	PCRE has been updated to version 6.7.

    o	The C function substituteList now has tail recursion expanded
	out, so C stack overflow is less likely.  (PR#8141, fix by
	Kevin Hendricks)

    o	The (somewhat soft) 1023/4 byte limit on command lines is now
	documented in 'An Introduction to R'.

    o	The maximum number of open connections has been increased from
	50 to 128.

    o	There is a new manual 'R Internals' on R internal stuctures
	plus the former appendices of 'Writing R Extensions'.

    o	The autoloads introduced at the package re-organization have been
	almost completely removed: the one that remains is for ts().

    o	The setting of the various Java configuration variables has been
	improved to refer to JAVA_HOME, and they are now documented in
	the R-admin manual.

    o	It is (again) possible to calculate prediction intervals from
	"lm" objects for the original data frame, now with a warning
	that the intervals refer to future observations.  Weighted
	intervals have also been implemented, with user-specifiable
	weights. Warnings are given in cases where the default
	behaviour might differ from user expectations.  See the
	?predict.lm for details.


CHANGES TO S4 METHODS

    o	The default prototype object for S4 classes will have its own
	internal type in 2.4.0, as opposed to being an empty list (the
	cause of several errors in the code up to 2.3.1).  Note that old
	binary objects, including class definitions, will be
	inconsistent with the type, and should be recreated.

    o	S4 method dispatch has been completely revised to use cached
	generic functions and to search for the best match among
	inherited methods.  See ?Methods and
	http://developer.r-project.org/howMethodsWork.pdf

    o	Objects created from an S4 class are now marked by an internal flag,
	tested by isS4() in R and by macro IS_S4_OBJECT() in C.	 This
	is an efficient and reliable test, and should replace all
	earlier heuristic tests.

    o	Some changes have been made to automatic printing of S4
	objects, to make this correspond to a call to show(), as per
	'Programming with Data'.

    o	S4 generic and class definitions are now cached when the related
	package is loaded.  This should improve efficiency and also
	avoid anomalous situations in which a class or generic cannot
	be found.

    o	trace() now creates a new S4 class for the traced object if
	required.  This allows tracing of user-defined subclasses of
	"function".


DEPRECATED & DEFUNCT

    o	The re-named tcltk functions tkcmd, tkfile.tail, tkfile.dir,
	tkopen, tkclose, tkputs, tkread are now defunct.

    o	Argument 'col' of bxp() has been removed: use 'boxfill'.

    o	Use of NULL as an environment is now an error.

    o	postscriptFont() is defunct: use Type1Font().

    o	La.chol() and La.chol2inv() are defunct (they were the same as
	the default options of chol() and chol2inv).

    o	La.svd(method = "dgesvd") is defunct.

    o	Files install.R and R_PROFILE.R in packages are now ignored
	(with a warning).

    o	The following deprecated command-line options to INSTALL have
	been removed (use the fields in the DESCRIPTION file instead):
	-s --save --no-save --lazy --no-lazy --lazy-data --no-lazy-data

    o	Graphical parameter 'tmag' is obsolete.

    o	mauchley.test() (package 'stats') is now defunct.

    o	symbol.C() and symbol.For() are deprecated.  They are required in
	S for use with is.loaded(), but are not so required in R.

    o	load()ing an object saved in one of the formats used prior to
	R 1.4.0 is deprecated.	Such objects should be re-saved in the
	current format.

    o	save(version = 1) is now deprecated.


C-LEVEL FACILITIES

    o	The convenience function ScalarLogical now coerces all
	non-zero non-NA values to TRUE.

    o	The vector accessor functions such as INTEGER, REAL and
	SET_VECTOR_ELT now check that they are called on the
	correct SEXPTYPE (or at least on a compatible one).  See
	`Writing R Extensions' for the details and for a stricter
	test regime.

    o	It is no longer possible to pass list variables to
	.C(DUP = FALSE): it would have given rise to obscure garbage
	collection errors.

    o	allocString is now a macro, so packages using it will need to
	be reinstalled.

    o	R_ParseVector was returning with object(s) protected in the
	parser if the status was PARSE_INCOMPLETE or PARSE_ERROR.

    o	There is a new function Rf_endEmbeddedR to properly terminate
	a session started by Rf_initEmbeddedR, and both are now
	available on Windows as well as on Unix-alikes.	 These and
	related functions are declared in a new header <Rembedded.h>.

	If R_TempDir is set when embedded R is initialized it is
	assumed to point to a valid session temporary directory: see
	`Writing R Extensions'.

    o	There is a new interface allowing one package to make C routines
	available to C code in other packages.	The interface consists
	of the routines R_RegisterCCallable and R_GetCCallable.	 These
	functions are declared in <R_ext/Rdynload.h>. This interface
	is experimental and subject to change.

	In addition, a package can arrange to make use of header
	files in another (already installed) package via the
	'LinkingTo' field in the DESCRIPTION file: see 'Writing R
	Extensions'.


UTILITIES

    o	R CMD SHLIB now handles (as linker commands) -L*, -l* and *.a.

    o	R CMD check now:

	- warns if there are non-ASCII characters in the R code (as
	  these will likely be syntax errors in some locale).

	- tests Rd cross-references by default, and tests for
	  (syntactically) valid CITATION metadata.

	- tests that the package can be loaded, and that the package
	  and namespace (if there is one) can each be loaded in
	  startup code (before the standard packages are loaded).

	- tests for empty 'exec' or 'inst' directories.

	- checks if $(FLIBS) is used when $(BLAS_LIBS) is.

	- checks that all packages (except non-S4-using standard
	  packages) used in ::, :::, library() and require() calls are
	  declared in the DESCRIPTION file, and 'methods' is declared if
	  S4 classes or methods are set.

	- throws an error if the standard packages 'methods' and
	  'stats4' are imported from in the NAMESPACE file and not
	  declared in the DESCRIPTION file.

    o	The test script produced by massage-Examples.pl no longer
	creates objects in the base environment.

    o	New utilties R CMD Stangle and R CMD Sweave for extracting S/R
	code from and processing Sweave documentation, respectively.

    o	The DESCRIPTION file of packages may contain an 'Enhances:'
	field.

    o	An R CMD javareconf script has been added to allow Java
	configuration to be updated even after R has been installed.


INSTALLATION

    o	The C function realpath (used by normalizePath()) is hidden on
	some systems and we try harder to find it.

    o	There is a new option --enable-BLAS-shlib, which compiles the
	BLAS into a dynamic library -lRblas and links against that.
	For the pros and cons see the R-admin manual.

	The defaults are now --without-blas (so you have explicitly to
	ask for an external BLAS), and --enable-BLAS-shlib unless
	a usable external BLAS is found or on AIX or on MacOS X 10.2
	and earlier.

    o	MacOS X did not like having LSAME in both BLAS and LAPACK
	libraries, so it is no longer part of the R-internal LAPACK.
	We now require an external BLAS to provide LSAME: it seems
	that nowadays all do.

    o	The configure test for 'whether mixed C/Fortran code can be
	run' has been improved as on one system that test passed but
	the Fortran run-time library was broken.

    o	A precious configure variable DEFS can be set to pass defines
	(e.g. -DUSE_TYPE_CHECKING_STRICT) to C code when compiling R.

    o	There is now a test for visible __libc_stack_end on Linux
	systems (since it is not visible on some recent glibc's
	built from the sources).

    o	MacOS X 10.4 and higher now use two-level namespaces, single
	module in a shared library and allow undefined symbols to be
	resolved at run-time. This implies that common symbols are now
	allowed in package libraries. --enable-BLAS-shlib is supported
	for internal BLAS, external BLAS framework and external static
	BLAS.  An external dynamic library BLAS is NOT supported. (But
	it can be easily used by replacing internal BLAS library file
	later.)	 MacOS X < 10.4 does not support --enable-BLAS-shlib.

    o	Dynamic libraries and modules use a flat namespace on MacOS X
	10.4 and higher if either Xcode tools don't support dynamic
	lookup (Xcode < 2.3) or the FORCE_FLAT_NAMESPACE environment
	variable is set.  (The latter was introduced temporarily for
	testing purposes and may go away anytime.)

    o	configure now defaults to 'run-time linking' on AIX
	(and AIX < 4.2 is no longer allowed), using -bexpall rather
	than export/import files.  If this works, it allows R to be
	built in the same way as other Unix-alikes, including with R
	as a shared library and with a shared BLAS.

    o	The "mac.binary" package type now defaults to universal
	binary.  If a repository supports architecture-specific Mac
	binaries, they can be requested by using "mac.binary.xxx" in
	contrib.url(), where xxx is the desired architecture.

    o   There is a new configure option --enable-memory-profiling to
        enable memory profiling with tracemem, Rprof, Rprofmem.


BUG FIXES

    o	The name of a Fortran symbol reported to be missing by
	.Fortran() is now the actual name.  (What was reported to be
	an 'entry point' was missing the common leading underscore.)

    o	print() on a MBCS character string now works properly a
	character at a time rather than a byte at time.	 (This does
	not affect MBCSs like UTF-8 and the Windows DBCSes which have
	non-ASCII lead bytes and always worked correctly.)

    o	glm() now recalculates the null deviance whenever there is an
	offset (even if it is exactly zero to avoid a discontinuity in
	that case, since the calculations with and without offset are
	done by different algorithms).

    o	Amongst families, quasi() accepted an expression for link and
	no other did.  Now all accept an expression which evaluates to
	a one-element character vector (although e.g. 'logit' is taken
	as a name and not an expression).

    o	trace() now accepts arguments where= and signature= for the
	old-style trace (no tracer or exit, edit==FALSE) and just
	prints a message on entry.  Also the undocumented feature of
	where=function now works for generic functions as well.

    o	callNextMethod() failed for recursive use when the methods had
	nonstandard argument lists.  Now enforces the semantic rule
	that the inheritance is fixed when the method containing the
	callNextMethod() is installed.	See Details in the documentation.

    o	UseMethod() looked for the defining environment of 'generic' as
	if it were the current function, although some functions are
	generic for methods of a different generic.

	Lookup for S3 methods is confined to functions: previously a
	non-function 'fun.class' could have masked a function of the
	same name.

    o	Line types (lty) specified as hex strings were documented not to
	allow zero, but some devices accepted zero and handled it in a
	device-dependent way.  Now it is an error on all devices.
	(PR#8914)

    o	Subassignment for a time series can no longer extend the series:
	it used to attempt to but failed to adjust the tsp attributes.
	Now window() must be used.

    o	Function AIC() in package 'stats4' was not dispatching correctly
	on S4 classes via logLik() because of namespace issues.

    o	Subsetting LANGSXPs could break the call-by-value illusion.
	(PR#7924) (patch from Kevin Hendricks).

    o	parse() with n > 1 gave a syntax error if fewer than n statements
	were available.

    o	parse() with n > 1 gave strange results on some syntax errors.
	(PR#8815)

    o	lag.plot() now respects graphical parameters for the axes.

    o	Using a wrong link in family() now gives more consistent error
	messages.

    o	sort.list(method="radix") works on factors again.

    o	object.size() is more accurate for vector objects (it takes into
	account the smaller header and also the fixed sizes used in
	the node classes for small vector objects).

    o	addmargins(T, ...) now returns a "table" when 'T' is a "table", as
	its help page has always suggested.

    o	remove() now explicitly precludes removing variables from
	baseenv() and throws an error (this was previously ignored).

    o	Saving the workspace at the end of a session now works as has
	long been intended, that is it is saved only if something has
	been added/deleted/changed during the current session.

    o	The search for bindings in <<-, ->> and assign(inherits=TRUE)
	was omitting the base package, although this was not
	documented.  Now the base package is included (but most
	bindings there are locked).

    o	dweibull(0, shape) was NaN not Inf for shape < 1.  Also, the
	help for dgamma and dweibull gave support as x > 0, but
	returned non-zero values for x = 0.  (PR#9080)

    o	Subsetting arrays no longer preserves attributes (it was
	removed for matrices in 1998).

    o	The "factor" method of as.character() no longer maps level
	"NA" to "<NA>" (a legacy of before there were NA character
	strings).

    o	terms(keep.order=TRUE) was not returning a valid "order"
	attribute.

    o	The DLL registration code was not freeing .External symbols.

    o	The internet download routines expected URLs of less than 4096
	bytes, but did not check.  Now this is checked, and http:// URLs
	are allowed to be up to 40960 bytes.

    o	parse(n=-1) threw a stack-imbalance error, and parse(n=3) did
	not cope correctly with EOF during input.

    o	Zero-column data frames had no names (rather than character(0)).

    o	by() and acf() could get confused when they used very long
	expressions as names.

    o	residuals(<glm object>, type="working") was NA for cases with
	zero weight (whereas they are well-defined even though the
	case was not used during the fitting) and the actual value is
	now returned.  This allows residuals to be computed from fits
	with 'y = FALSE'.

	The residuals in a fitted "glm" object are computed more
	accurately: the previous formula was subject to cancellation.

    o	loess() now checks the validity of its 'control' argument.

    o	rownames(<0-row matrix>, do.NULL=FALSE) was wrong.  (PR#9136)

    o	apply() now works as documented when applied over 2 or more
	margins with one of zero extent.  (It used to drop dimensions.)

    o	head() and tail() now also work row-wise for "table" and "ftable"
	objects.

    o	NextMethod() could throw an error/crash if called from a method
	that was called directly rather than from a generic (so
	.Method was unset).

    o	order(x, na.last = NA) failed for a zero-length x.

    o	grep(pat, x, value = TRUE, perl = L) preserved names for
	L == TRUE && !is.na(pat) but not otherwise.  Now it always does.

    o	[rc]bind() now find registered methods and not just visible ones.

    o	Printing a factor no longer ignores attributes such as names and
	dim/dimnames.

    o	Command-line arguments after --encoding were ignored.

    o	The check for impossible confidence levels was off by one in
	wilcox.test (PR#8557)

    o	[[ on an environment could create aliases. (PR#8457)

    o	pt() with a very small (or zero) non-centrality parameter could
	give an unduly stringent warning about 'full precision was not
	achieved'.  (PR#9171)

    o	writeChar() could segfault if 'nchars' was given silly values.

    o	qt() and rt() did not work for vector 'ncp', and qt() did not
	work for negative 'ncp'.

    o	ns() failed to work correctly when 'x' was of length one.

    o	identical() ignored tags on pairlists (including names of
	attributes) and required an identical ordering for
	attribute values in their pairlists.  Now names are compared
	on pairlists, and attribute sets are treated as unordered.

    o	If they were unused arguments supplied to a closure, only
	the first non-empty one was reported, despite the message.

	Unmatched empty arguments (such as f(1,,) for a function of
	one argument) were ignored.  They are now an error.

    o	Calling a builtin with empty arguments used to silently remove
	them (and this was undocumented).  Now this is an error unless
	builtin is c() or list() or there are only trailing empty
	arguments, when it is a warning (for the time being: this will
	be made an error in R 2.5.0).

    o	install.packages() ignored 'configure.args' if the vector was
	unnamed.

    o	biplot() now works if there are missing values in the data.

    o	biplot() now passes par() values to all four axes (not
	just those on sides 1 and 2).

    o	[.acf now handles an empty first index.

    o	Deparsing uses backticks more consistently to quote
	non-syntactic names.

    o	Assigning to the symbol in a for() loop with a
	list/expression/pairlist index could alter the index.  Now the
	loop variable is explicitly read-only.	(PR#9216)

    o	Using old.packages() (and hence update.packages()) on an empty
	(or non-existent) library failed with an obscure message.

    o	plot.xy() could segfault if supplied with an invalid 'col'
	argument.  (PR#9221)

    o	menu() with graphics=TRUE attempted to use Tcl/Tk on unix even
	if DISPLAY was not set (in which case Tk is not available and
	so the attempt is bound to fail).

    o	The print() method for 'dist' objects prints a matrix even for
	n = 2.

    o	The cumxxx functions were missing some PROTECTs and so could
	segfault on long vectors (especially with names or where
	coercion to numeric occurred).

    o	The X11() device no longer produces (apparently spurious)
	'BadWindow (invalid Window parameter)' warnings when run from
	Rcmdr.

    o	legend() assumed that widths and heights of strings were positive,
	which they need not be in user coordinates with reversed axes.
	(In part, PR#9236)

    o	The plot() methods for "profile.nls" objects could get
	confused if 'which' had been used in the profile() call. (PR#9231)

    o	boxplot() did not passed named arguments (except graphics
	parameters) to bxp() as documented.  (PR#9183)

    o	Only genuinely empty statements act as 'return' in the
	browser, not say those starting with a comment char.  (PR#9063)

   o	summary.mlm() incorrectly used accessor functions to fake an
	"lm" object.  (PR#9191)

   o	prettyNum() was not preserving attributes, despite being
	explicitly documented to. (PR#8695)

   o	It was previously undocumented what happened if a graphical
	parameter was passed in both '...' and 'pars' to boxplot()
	and bxp(), and they behaved differently.  Now those passed in
	'...' have precedence in both cases.

    o	A failed subassignment could leave behind an object '*tmp*'.
	The fix also sometimes gives better error messages.

    o	Using SIGUSR1 on Unix now always terminates a session, and no
	longer is caught by browser contexts and restarts (such as try()).

    o   In the 'graphics' package, in-line 'font=5' was being ignored
        (report by Tom Cook).

    o   nls() looked for non-parameter arguments in a function call in
	the wrong scope (from the body of nls).

    o   Printing of complex numbers could misbehave when one of the
	parts was large (so scientific notation was used) and the
	other was so much smaller that it had no significant digits
	and should have been printed as zero (e.g. 1e80+3e44i).

    o	Using install.packages with type="mac.binary" and target path
	starting with ~ failed with a cryptic message while unpacking.

    o	getwd() now works correctly when the working directory is
	unavailable (e.g. unreadable).

    o	The alternative hypothesis in wilcox.test() was labelled by an
	unexplained quantity 'mu' which is now spelled out.

	The alternative hypothesis in ks.test() is clearer both in the
	documentation and in the result. (PR#5360)

		CHANGES IN R VERSION 2.3.1 patched


BUG FIXES

    o	help.search() incorrectly documented where the data base was
	saved and what was in it.

    o	str(<data.frame>, strict.width=.) produced an extraneous first line.

    o	Improve bessel[IJKY]() out-of-range checks; for instance,
	besselI(0, nu) no longer warns.

    o	cbind() on some non-vector objects (e.g. names) segfaulted.

    o	xy.coords(numeric(0)) gave a misleading error message.

    o	INSTALL has been changed to avoid a few problems with the
	base (not XPG4) Solaris sed.

    o	There were problems in src/main/printutils.c on some platforms
	that did not have va_copy.

    o	[pq]unif allowed infinite ranges but handled them
	inconsistently.  (PR#8958)

	[pq]unif claimed to allow min == max but did not do so.

    o	Subassignment within raw arrays of 3 or more dimensions was not
	implemented.

    o	environment<-() did not even check if duplication was required.

    o	rt() was wrong for non-central t-distributions. qt() was wrong
	for non-central distributions far enough in the left tail
	(reported by Long Qu).  (PR#9050)

    o	R CMD Rdconv --type=Ssgm no longer drops a \keyword{} if it is the
	only one (one letter typo patch by Bill Dunlap).  (PR#9051)

    o	poly(x, y, .., raw = TRUE) now does follow 'raw'.

    o	plot(0/ -1:1, type = "s") now works.  (PR#9046)

    o	write.table(row.names=FALSE) does now quote column names. (PR#9044)

    o	rf() was wrong for non-central F (PR#9055). qf() was wrong for
	non-central F with denominator df > 1e8.

    o	The C function dummy_vfprint had a potential memory leak.  This
	showed up with some connections when used with output of more
	than 100,000 bytes in a single call.

    o	vignette() did not work if more than one vignette with the
	same name was installed  (PR#9069).

    o	mget() did not check that 'ifnotfound' was a list, and worked
	incorrectly if it was a list of length > 1.  Now 'ifnotfound'
	is (if possible) coerced to a list.

    o	The internal check for conformance of time series assumed that the
	'tsp' attribute was integer, whereas it was enforced to be
	numeric by the attribute-setting code.

    o   Sweave() did not treat \begin{document} in comments correctly
	(PR#9073).

    o	diff(x) gave wrong result when x was "POSIXlt" object.

    o	title() could crash R when passed a long non-character vector.
	(PR#9115)

    o	Functions rgb(), hsv() and hcl() lost names unless 'alpha' was
	specified.  (In part, PR#9118)

    o	The residuals() method for "glm" failed unless 'y = TRUE' for
	the fit: it now works for "working" and "partial" residuals
	and gives a useful error message for other types. (PR#9124)

    o	R CMD Rdconv did not close the .Rd file, which matters on Windows.
	(PR#9126)

    o	anova.mlm() could fail if applied to a single model.

    o	stopifnot(<FALSE-expr>) now gives a better message for a *long*
	expression.




		CHANGES IN R VERSION 2.3.1


NEW FEATURES

    o	In lm() and glm(), offsets are allowed to be length 1 (and
	if so are replicated to the number of cases).

    o	The \uxxxx notation for Unicode characters in input strings
	can now be used on any platform which supports MBCS, even if
	the current locale is not MBCS (provided that the Unicode
	character is valid in the current character set).

    o	The quasibinomial() family now allows the "cauchit" link. (PR#8851)

    o	edit.data.frame() no longer (silently) coerces character columns
	to factor.


C-LEVEL FACILITIES

    o	The variables controlling stack checking are made available via
	Rinterface.h to front-ends embedding R: see 'Writing R Extensions'

    o	R_SignalHandlers (defined in Rinterface.h) can be set to 0 to
	suppress the R signal handlers in front-ends embedding R.


INSTALLATION CHANGES

    o	There have been a number of changes to help installation on
	platforms that no one had beta-tested.

	- Changes related to older header files, e.g. on Redhat 8.0/9.

	- Problems with 'make install' on older (<3) versions of bash
	  on Solaris and elsewhere.

	- AIX 5.2/gcc issues with needing -lm when making modules X11
	  and vfonts.

	- Some versions of Solaris and AIX had an fcntl.h that
	  redefined 'open' to be 'open64' and thereby broke
	  compilation of src/main/connections.c and elsewhere.

    o	'make uninstall' works better on a build using a named
	subarchitecture.


BUG FIXES

    o	min(), max(), sum() and prod() gave nonsensical answers with
	an empty list or raw argument.

    o	sum() on a data frame did not allow multiple arguments.	 (PR#8385)

    o	charmatch() and pmatch() did not specify they applied only to
	character vectors.  Now they do, and attempt to coerce 'x' and
	'target' to character before attempting matching.

    o	The Summary() methods for data.frame, Date, POSIXct, POSIXlt
	and difftime all required an argument which can match 'x',
	although the generics did not.

    o	regexpr() now accepts 0-length 'text' inputs.

    o	help.search() no longer errors out on a wrongly installed package
	(with no "hsearch.rds" file).

    o	The LaTeX version of the package reference manual was omitting
	some topics, and was not sorting the foo-package topic first.

    o	Serializing (e.g. via save()) is better protected against C
	stack overflow, which will now abort the conversion but no
	longer crashes the R process on some platforms.

    o	rbind()ing dataframes with a single row could lead to a
	corrupt data frame (a problem with the fix to PR#8506).

    o	plot(lm(y ~ 1)) now works also for 'which = 5'.

    o	dbeta(0, 1, a, 0) now correctly gives 'a' (limit) instead of 0,
	and dbeta(0, a, b, ncp) now returns Inf instead of NaN.

    o	demo(Hershey) was failing on the Cyrillic octal codes in locales
	(e.g. UTF-8) in which these are invalid.

    o	mean() on an integer (or logical) vector was treating NAs as
	actual values (unless na.rm = TRUE).

    o	mean() on a complex vector was calculated incorrectly in
	code to improve precision (PR#8842, John Peters).

    o	Graphical parameters bg, cex, col, lty, and lwd were being
	checked as being of length one even by functions such as
	title() that ignored them.  (Functions such as lines() and
	points() allow them to be of length > 1, so they might be
	passed through ... to other high-level graphical functions
	which then used to reject them.)

    o	str() now is fast again for large character vectors.

    o	edit() would default the environment of a function to .BaseEnv,
	instead of to .GlobalEnv.

    o	lm() and glm() coerce their 'weights' and 'offset' values to
	vector to avoid problems with specifying them as 1D or n x 1
	arrays.

    o	image() with one or both axes on log scales would give a
	spurious warning; contour() would give an error.

    o	legend() with log axes would place the title in the wrong place.

    o	edit.data.frame() was not returning factors edited with
	factor.mode="numeric" to factors.

    o	edit.matrix() tried to set rownames and colnames from the
	original matrix even if the sizes had been altered, and
	ignored changes made to the column names.  'edit.row.names' has
	a more sensible default (if the rownames are non-NULL).

    o	bindingIsLocked() was returning invalid values of a logical
	vector on some platforms.

    o	merge.data.frame() did not make the column names unique (by
	appending elements of 'suffixes') when performing a Cartesian
	product.  (PR#8676)

    o	rbind.data.frame() matches up the names of columns (which was
	undocumented), but failed to do so when checking if it was
	dealing with a factor column.  (PR#8868)

	If rbind() was used on data frames with duplicated names it
	produced a corrupt data frame.

    o	dt(x, df, ncp= not.0) no longer gives erratic values for
	|x| < ~1e-12.  (PR#8874)

    o	\code{\linkS4class{.}} now works.

    o	ccf() aligns time series by ts.intersect() rather than
	ts.union() and so is less likely to need a non-default
	na.action.  (PR#8893)

    o	optim(method="CG") could return a value that did not
	correspond to $par for very badly behaved functions on which
	the second phase of the line search failed.  (PR#8786)

    o	print.ts() could fail on a corrupt time series: it now warns and
	does the best it can.




		CHANGES IN R VERSION 2.3.0


USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o	In the grid package there are new 'arrow' arguments to
	grid.line.to(), grid.lines(), and grid.segments()
	(grid.arrows() has been deprecated).

	The new 'arrow' arguments have been added BEFORE
	the 'name', 'gp' and 'vp' arguments so existing code that
	specifies any of these arguments *by position* (not by name)
	will fail.

    o	all.equal() is more stringent, see the PR#8191 bug fix below.

    o	The data frame argument to transform() is no longer called 'x',
	but '_data'.  Since this is an invalid name, it is less likely
	to clash with names given to transformed variables. (People
	were getting into trouble with transform(data, x=y+z).)


NEW FEATURES

    o	arima.sim() has a new argument 'start.innov' for compatibility
	with S-PLUS.  (If not supplied, the output is unchanged from
	previous versions in R.)

    o	arrows() has been changed to be more similar to segments():
	for example col=NA omits the arrow rather than as previously
	(undocumented) using par("col").

    o	as.list() now accepts symbols (as given by as.symbol() aka
	as.name()).

    o	atan2() now allows one complex and one numeric argument.

    o	The 'masked' warnings given by attach() and library() now only
	warn for functions masking functions or non-functions masking
	non-functions.

    o	New function Axis(), a generic version of axis(), with Date and
	POSIX[cl]t methods.  This is used by most of the standard
	plotting functions (boxplot, contour, coplot, filled.contour,
	pairs, plot.default, rug, stripchart) which will thus label x
	or y axes appropriately.

    o	pbeta() now uses TOMS708 in all cases and so is more accurate
	in some (e.g. when lower.tail = FALSE and when one of the
	shape parameters is very small).

    o	[qr]beta(), [qr]f() and [qr]t() now have a non-centrality parameter.

    o	[rc]bind and some more cases of subassignment are implemented
	for raw matrices.  (PR8529 and 8530)

    o	The number of lines of deparsed calls printed by browser() and
	traceback() can be limited by the option "deparse.max.lines".
	(Wish of PR#8638.)

    o	New canCoerce() utility function in "methods" package.

    o	[pq]chisq() are considerably more accurate for moderate (up to
	80) values of ncp, and lower.tail = FALSE is fully supported
	in that region.	 (They are somewhat slower than before.)

    o	chol(pivot = TRUE) now gives a warning if used on a (numerically)
	non-positive-definite matrix.

    o	chooseCRANmirror() consults the CRAN master (if accessible) to
	find an up-to-date list of mirrors.

    o	cov.wt() is more efficient for 'cor = TRUE' and has a new 'method'
	argument which allows 'Maximum Likelihood'.

    o	do.call() gains an 'envir' argument.

    o	eigen() applied to an asymmetric real matrix now uses a
	tolerance to decide if the result is complex (rather than
	expecting the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues to be exactly
	zero).

    o	New function embedFonts() for embedding fonts in PDF or
	PostScript graphics files.

    o	fisher.test() now uses p-values computed via hypergeometric
	distributions for all 2 by 2 tables.  This might be slightly
	slower for a few cases, but works much better for tables with
	some large counts.

	There is a new option to simulate the p-value for larger than
	2 x 2 tables.

    o	for() now supports raw vectors as the set of indices.

    o	getNativeSymbolInfo() is vectorized for the 'name' argument.  It
	returns a named list of NativeSymbolInfo objects, but is
	backward compatible by default when called with a character
	vector of length 1, returning the NativeSymbolInfo object.

    o	help.search() no longer attempts to handle packages installed
	prior to R 2.0.0, and reports the current path to the
	package (rather than where it was originally installed: this
	information is not shown by the print() method).

    o	Added "hexmode" to parallel "octmode".

    o	install.packages() now does tilde expansion on file paths
	supplied as 'pkgs'.

    o	install.packages() has additional arguments 'configure.args' and
	'clean' which allow the caller to provide additional arguments
	to the underlying R CMD INSTALL shell command when installing
	source packages on a Unix-alike.

    o	is.loaded() has a new argument 'type' to confine the search to
	symbols for .C, .Fortran, .Call or .External: by default it
	looks for a symbol which will match any of them.  It is now
	internal and not primitive, so argument matching works in the
	usual way.

    o	The symmetry test for matrices used in eigen() has been ``exported''
	as the 'matrix' method of a new S3-generic 'isSymmetric().

    o	.leap.seconds and the internal adjustment code now know about
	the 23rd leap second on 2005-12-31: the internal code uses a
	run-time test to see if the OS does.

    o	The 'col' argument of legend() now defaults to par("col")
	(which defaults to "black", the previous default), so that
	the lines/symbols are shown in the legend in the colour that
	is used on the plot.

    o	log2() and log10() call C functions of the same name if
	available, and will then be more likely to be precise to
	machine accuracy.

    o	new.packages() gains a ... argument to pass e.g. 'destdir' to
	install.packages().  (Wish of PR#8239.)

    o	nls() now supports 'weights'.

    o	The vector passed as the first argument of the 'fn' and 'gr'
	arguments of optim() has the names (if any) given to argument
	'par'.

    o	options(expressions) is temporarily increased by 500 during
	error-handling.	  This enables e.g. traceback() to work when
	the error is reaching the limit on the nesting of expressions.

    o	page() accepts general R objects, not just names (and
	previously undocumented) character strings.  This allows the
	object to be specified as a call, for example.	More options
	are allowed in its '...' argument.

    o	pairs() allows a wider class of inputs, including data frames
	with date and date-time columns.

    o	par() and the in-line use of graphical parameters produce more
	informative error messages, distinguishing between
	non-existent pars and inappropriate use of valid pars.

	Graphical parameters 'family', 'lend', 'ljoin' and 'lmitre'
	can now be set in-line.

	There is no longer a warning if non-settable pars are used
	in-line, but there is an appropriate warning if unknown pars
	are passed.

	The length limit for the 'family' parameter has been increased
	to 200 bytes, to allow for the names of some CID-keyed fonts
	in multi-byte locales.

    o	The pdf() device now allows 'family' to be specified in the same
	generality as postscript().

    o	The pdf() device writes /FontDescriptor entries for all fonts
	except the base 14, and does not write font entries for unused
	fonts.

    o	Plotmath allows 'vartheta', 'varphi' and 'varsigma' (or 'stigma')
	as synonyms for 'theta1', 'phi1' and 'sigma1', and the help
	page has a note for TeX users.

    o	plot.xy() now takes its default arguments from the
	corresponding par() settings, so points(type="l") and
	lines(type="p") behave in the same way (and more obviously,
	also for type="b").

    o	poly() has a new argument 'raw', mainly for pedagogical purposes.

    o	The class "POSIXlt" now supports fractional seconds (as
	"POSIXct" has always done).  The printing of fractional seconds
	is controlled by the new option "digits.secs", and by default is off.

    o	postscript() supports family = "ComputerModernItalic" for
	Computer Modern with italic (rather than slanted) faces.

    o	The postscript()/pdf() font metrics for the 14 standard fonts
	(only, not the rest of the common 35) have been updated to
	versions from late 1999 which cover more glyphs.  There are
	also a few differences in the metrics and hence the output
	might be slightly different in some cases.

    o	The way families can be specified for postscript() and pdf()
	has been expanded to include CID-keyed fonts, with new
	functions Type1Font() and CIDFont() to set up such fonts
	families.

    o	prettyNum() has new arguments 'preserve.width' and 'zero.print'.
	When the former is not "none", as in calls from format() and
	formatC(), the resulting strings are kept at the desired width
	when possible even after adding of 'big.mark' or 'small.mark'.

    o	proc.time() and system.time() now record times to 1ms accuracy
	where available (most Unix-like systems).

    o	The initialization methods for the quasi() family have been
	changed to depend on the variance function, and in particular
	to work better for the "mu(1-mu)" variance function.  (PR#8486)

    o	read.table() gains a 'flush' argument passed to scan().

    o	require() now takes a 'lib.loc' argument.

    o	The second argument 'size' to sample() is required to have
	length 1, so that errors when supplying arguments are more
	easily detected.

    o	The default is now compress = !ascii in save() (but not save.image).

    o	scan() and write.table() now have some interruptibility, which
	may be useful when processing very large files.

    o	A new heuristic test, seemsS4Object() is supplied, along with a
	similar C-level test, R_seemsS4Object(object). The test
	detects probable S4 objects by their class's attribute. See
	the help page.

    o	S3 classes can now be made non-virtual S4 classes by supplying a
	prototype object in the arguments to setOldClass().

    o	splinefun() returns a function that now also has a 'deriv' argument
	and can provide up to the 3rd derivative of the interpolating
	spline, thanks to Berwin Turlach.

    o	stopifnot(A) now gives a better error message when A has NAs, and
	uses "not all TRUE" when A has length >= 2.

    o	str()'s default method has a new argument 'strict.width' which can
	be used to produce strict 'width' conforming output.  A new
	options(str = list(strict.width = *)) setting allows to control
	this for a whole session.

    o	summary.nls() has a new argument 'correlation' that defaults
	to FALSE (like summary.lm).

    o	Sys.sleep() has sub-millisecond resolution on Unix-alikes
	with gettimeofday().

    o	Sys.time() now has sub-millisecond accuracy on systems
	supporting the POSIX call gettimeofday, and clock-tick
	accuracy on Windows.

    o	The new function timestamp() adds a time stamp to the saved
	command history on consoles which support it.

    o	New function tcrossprod() for efficiently computing x %*% t(x)
	and x %*% t(y).

    o	The suffix used by tempfile() is now in hex on all platforms
	and guaranteed to be at least 6 hex digits (usually 8).

    o	trace() now works more consistently and more like its
	documentation, in particular the assertions about old tracing
	being removed for new.	For debugging purposes (of R) a
	mechanism for debugging the trace computations themselves was
	added.	See trace.R.

    o	The implementation of trace() has beem made more general by
	calling a function to do the trace interaction, and recover()
	now detects trace calls to trim the irrelevant code underneath.

    o	unserialize() can now also read a byte stream from a raw vector.

    o	The useDynLib() directive in the NAMESPACE file now accepts the
	names of the native/foreign symbols that are to be resolved in
	the DLL for use in .C/.Call/.Fortran/.External calls.  These
	can be used as regular R variables instead of the (routine
	name, PACKAGE) pairs currently recommended.  Alternative names
	can be given for the R variables mapping to these symbols.
	The native routine registration information can also be used
	directly via useDynLib(name, .registration = TRUE).  See the
	'Writing R Extensions' manual for more details.

	checkFF() (package 'tools') has been updated accordingly.

    o	validObject() has an option complete=TRUE that recursively
	checks the objects in the slots.  Not used when new(...)
	checks validity.

    o	New Vectorize() function, a wrapper for mapply().

    o	write.ftable() has gained an argument 'append = FALSE' (thanks to
	Stephen Weigand).

    o	On Unix-alikes, X11() now has arguments to request the initial
	position of the window, and 'gamma' defaults to the value of
	getOptions("gamma").  These changes are consistent with the
	windows() device.

    o	X11() and the Unix-alike data entry window can have properties
	(including geometry) set by X resources: see their help files.

    o	xy.coords() & xyz.coords() now have NULL defaults for their 'y' or
	'y' and 'z' arguments.	This is more consistent with their earlier
	documentation, and may be convenient for using them.


    o	Non-syntactic names of list elements are now printed quoted by
	backticks rather than double quotes.

    o	There is some basic checking for imminent C stack overflow (when
	the evaluation depth and the user interrupts are checked).
	On systems with suitable OS support (not Windows), segfaults
	from C stack overflow are caught and treated as an R error.

	New function Cstack_info() reports on stack size and usage.

	options(expressions) reverts to the default of 5000 now
	stack checking is in place.

    o	Package tcltk does not try to initialize Tk on Unix-alikes
	unless a DISPLAY variable is present.  This allows packages
	dependent on tcltk to be installed without access to an X server.

    o	The code used to guess timezone offsets where not supplied by
	the OS uses a different algorithm that is more likely to guess
	the summer-time transitions correctly.

    o	Package tools contains translation tables 'Adobe_glyphs' and
	'charset_to_Unicode'.

    o	Changed the environment tree to be rooted in an empty
	environment, available as emptyenv().  baseenv() has been
	modified to return an environment with emptyenv() as parent,
	rather than NULL.

    o	gettext has been updated to 0.14.5.

    o	PCRE has been updated to version 6.4.

    o	The method $.DLLInfo resolves the specified symbol in the DLL,
	returning a NativeSymbolInfo object.  Use [[ to access the actual
	values in the DLLInfo object.

    o	On systems with either vasprintf or both va_copy and a vsnprintf
	which reports the size of buffer required, connections such as
	gzfile() and bzfile() can now write arbitrarily long lines,
	not just 100000 chars.

    o	The R session temporary directory is now set in C code using
	the same algorithm whether or not the shell front-end is used
	and on all platforms.  This looks at environment variables
	TMPDIR, TMP and TEMP in turn, and checks if they point to a
	writable directory.

    o	Some of the classical tests put unnecessary restrictions on the
	LHS in the formula interface (e.g., t.test(x+y ~ g) was not
	allowed).

    o	On suitably equipped Unix-alike systems, segfaults, illegal
	operations and bus errors are caught and there is a simple
	error-handler which gives the user some choice as to what to
	do in interactive use. [Experimental.]

	On Windows access violations and illegal instructions are
	caught with a simple error handler.  [Experimental.]

    o	Tracebacks now include calls such as .C/.Fortran/.Call, which
	will help if errors occur in R code evaluated by compiled code
	and in tracebacks presented by the segfault etc handlers.

    o	Treatment of signature objects and method definition objects has
	been modified to give cleaner printing and more consistency in
	the treatment of signatures.  A sometimes useful utility,
	methodSignatureMatrix(), is now exported.

    o	Printing the results of codoc() from package tools now helpfully
    	summarizes the found code/documentation mismatches.

    o	R refrains from printing a final EOL upon exiting the main loop
	if the quiet flag is on and if the save action is known (e.g. this
	is true for --slave).


DEPRECATED & DEFUNCT

    o	The deprecated and undocumented use of atan() with two arguments
	has been removed: instead use atan2().

    o	write.table0() is defunct in favour of write.table().

    o	format.char() is defunct in favour of format.default().

    o	Support for the long-deprecated (and no longer documented)
	arguments --min-vsize --min-nsize --max-vsize --max-nsize
	--vsize --nsize of R CMD BATCH has been removed.

    o	The 'debian' subdirectory has been removed from the sources.

    o	The 'vfont' argument of axis() and mtext() has been removed:
	use par(family=) instead.

    o	The unused graphical parameter "type" has been removed: it
	invited confusion with the 'type' argument to default methods
	of plot(), points() and lines().

    o	nlsMethod() and profiler() are no longer exported from the stats
	namespace (and nlsMethod.plinear() is no longer registered as
	a method, as nlsMethod() was not generic).

    o	The re-named tcltk functions tkcmd, tkfile.tail, tkfile.dir,
	tkopen, tkclose, tkputs, tkread are now formally deprecated.

    o	Argument 'col' of bxp() is now formally deprecated.

    o	Use of NULL as an environment is deprecated and gives a warning.

    o	postscriptFont() is deprecated in favour of Type1Font() (which
	is just a change of name).

    o	La.chol() and La.chol2inv() are deprecated (they have since R
	1.7.0 been the same as the default options of chol() and chol2inv).

    o	La.svd(method = "dgesvd") is deprecated.

    o	The use of install.R and R_PROFILE.R files in packages is
	deprecated: use the DESCRIPTION file instead to arrange to
	save an image or to load dependent packages.

	The following command-line options to INSTALL are deprecated
	(use the fields in the DESCRIPTION file instead):
	-s --save --no-save --lazy --no-lazy --lazy-data --no-lazy-data

    o	Graphical parameter 'tmag' (which is long unused) is deprecated.


INTERNATIONALIZATION

	A set of patches supplied by Ei-ji Nakama has been incorporated.

    o	New postscript encodings for CP1253, CP1257 and Greek (ISO 8859-7).

    o	Support for East Asian CID-keyed fonts in pdf() and postscript().
	Although these usually contain Latin characters no accurate
	AFMs are available and so CID-keyed fonts are intended only
	for use with CJK characters.

    o	Wide-character width functions wc[s]width are provided that
	overcome problems found with OS-supplied ones (and those
	previously used by R on Windows).  This means that
	double-width CJK characters are now supported on all
	platforms.  It seems that the width of some characters (and
	not just CJK characters) depends on which CJK locale's fonts
	are in use and also on the OS.

	Revised wide-character classification functions are
	provided for use on Windows, AIX and MacOS X to replace
	deficient OS-supplied ones.

   o	There is support for MBCS charsets in the pictex() graphics
	device, and rotated (by 90 degrees) text may work better.

   o	The \u (and \U except on Windows) notation for characters which
	is supported by the parser in all MBCS charsets is now always
	interpreted as a Unicode point, even on platforms which do not
	encode wchar_t in Unicode.  These are now a syntax error in
	single-byte locales.

    o	The default encoding for postscript() and pdf() is chosen to
	be suitable for the current locale, if that is a single-byte
	locale which is supported.  This covers European (including
	Greek) and Cyrillic languages.

	In UTF-8 locales, a suitable single-byte encoding is chosen
	for postscript() and pdf(), and text translated to it.

    o	xfig() gains an 'encoding' argument.

    o	There are some message translations into Spanish.


INSTALLATION CHANGES

    o	The encoding files for pdf()/postscript() have been moved to
	directory 'enc' in package 'grDevices'.

    o	Support for MBCS is only enabled if iconv is found and it
	supports enough conversions.  (libiconv does.)

    o	In an MBCS locale, make check now translates the graphics
	examples from Latin-1.	This ensures that they will work
	correctly in UTF-8: it is possible that in other MBCS locales
	they will now fail (rather than work completely incorrectly).

    o	There is a new test, 'test-Docs', which as part of 'make
	check-devel' tests the code in the documentation.  Currently
	it runs doc/manual/R-{exts,intro}.R and the compiled code in
	R-exts.c.

    o	The workaround to allow an external LAPACK-containing BLAS
	such as libsunperf to be used with the internal LAPACK has
	been removed.  If you have such a library you may now need
	to use --with-lapack.  It is no longer possible to use some
	older versions of libsunperf, e.g. Forte 7 on 64-bit builds.

    o	A substitute for mkdtemp is provided, so it is now always
	used for R_TempDir.

    o	Most of the functions checked for by 'configure' also have
	declarations checked for in the appropriate header.

    o	The top-level documentation files AUTHORS COPYING.LIB COPYRIGHTS
	FAQ RESOURCES THANKS have been moved to doc, and COPYING and NEWS
	are installed there.  The file Y2K has been removed from the
	distribution.

    o	The extension .lo is no longer used in building R (only in
	the optional build of libRmath.so): this allows a considerable
	simplification of the Makefiles.

    o	Direct support for f2c has been removed: it can still be used
	via a script which makes it look like a Fortran compiler.
	(src/scripts/f77_f2c is an example of such a script.)

    o	There is a new flag SAFE_FFLAGS which is used for the
	compilation of dlamc.f.	 It is set by configure for known
	problem cases (recent g77 and gfortran), but can be overridden
	by the user.

    o	The standard autoconf macros for large-file support are now used,
	and these are enabled unless --disable-largefile is specified.
	This replaces --enable-linux-lfs (and is now selected by default).

    o	Visibility attributes are used where supported (gcc4/gfortran on
	some platforms, also gcc3/g77 on FC3 and partially elsewhere).
	The main benefit should be faster loading (and perhaps better
	optimized code) in some of the dynamic shared objects (e.g.
	libR.so and stats.so).

    o	The *PICFLAGS are taken to be -fpic rather than -fPIC where
	possible.   This will make no difference on most platforms:
	-fPIC is needed on Sparc (and still used there), but -fpic
	should give slightly better performance on PowerPC (although
	-fPIC is used on PPC64 as it is needed to build libR.so there).

    o	More use is made of inlining for small utility functions such
	as isReal.  Because this can only be done portably with C99
	constructs (and we know of no actual implementation), this is
	only done for the GNU C compiler.

    o	There is an experimental feature to allow shared installations
	of sub-architectures.  See the R-admin manual.

    o	All platforms now use R's internal implementation of strptime,
	which allows fractional seconds.  (The major platforms were
	already using it.)

    o	The dlcompat work-around for old Mac OS X systems (<= 10.2)
	has been removed.  External dlcompat must be installed if needed.


UTILITIES

    o	R CMD check now uses an install log by default.

    o	R CMD check works for packages whose package name is different
	from the directory name in which it is located.

    o	R CMD INSTALL now uses more randomness in the temporary
	directory name even on systems without mktemp -d.

    o	R CMD f77 has been removed now f2c is no longer supported.

    o	The version string shown in the startup message and by
	"R --version", and that stored in variable R.version.string
	are now in exactly the same format.

    o	The base name of a help file needs to be valid as part of a file://
	URL, so R CMD check now checks the names are ASCII and do not
	contain % .

    o	R CMD check now warns about unknown sections in Rd files, and
	invalid names for help, demo and R files, as well as unlikely
	file names in the 'src' directory.  The latter is controlled
	by option --check-subdirs and by default is done if checking a
	tarball without a configure script.

	R CMD build excludes invalid files in the 'man', 'R' and 'demo'
	subdirectories.

    o	\usepackage[noae]{Sweave} in the header of an Sweave file
	supresses auto-usage of the ae package ("almost European"
	fonts) and T1 input encoding.


DOCUMENTATION

    o	Rd format now allows \var{} markup inside \code{} and \examples{}.

    o	Markup such as --, ---, < and > is handled better when
	converting .Rd files to [C]HTML.

    o	There is new markup \link[=dest]{name} to generate a link to topic
	'dest' which is shown as 'name', and \linkS4class{abc} which
	expands to \link[=abc-class]{abc}, for cross-referencing the
	recommended form of documentation for S4 classes.


PACKAGE INSTALLATION

    o	There is now some support for Fortran 90/95 code in packages:
	see `Writing R Extensions'.

    o	Installation of man sources and demos is now done by R code.
	The restrictions on the names of help files, R files and
	of demos are now enforced (see `Writing R Extensions').

    o	Packages which contain compiled code can now have more than
	one dot in their name even on Windows.

    o	The Meta/hsearch.rds database saved now contains LibPath="".
	This information is now always recreated when help.search() is
	run, but the field is retained for back-compatibility.

    o	update.packages() now has a '...' argument to be passed to
	install.packages(), including the formerly separate arguments
	'destdir' and 'installWithVers'.

    o	Make macros AR and RANLIB are now declared in etc/Makeconf for
	use by packages which wish to make static libraries.


C-LEVEL FACILITIES

    o	qgamma and rgamma in Rmath.h now check for non-positive arguments.

    o	The BLAS which ships with R now contains the complete set of
	double-complex BLAS routines, rather than just those used in R.

	<R_ext/BLAS.h> has been corrected to add the missing
	double-precision BLAS functions drotmg and drotm, and to
	exclude lsame (which is a Lapack auxiliary function and is now
	declared in <R_ext/Lapack.h>).	It also includes the double
	complex routines added for this release of R provided Fortran
	doublecomplex is usable on the platform.

    o	<R_ext/BLAS.h> and <R_ext/Lapack.h> now declare all the entry
	points as 'extern'.

    o	The flag SAFE_FFLAGS is made available to packages via
	etc/Makeconf and R CMD config.	It can be used where
	optimization needs to be defeated, e.g. in LAPACK setup.

    o	getNativeSymbolInfo has a withRegistrationInfo argument which
	causes the address field to be a reference to the registration
	information if it is available for that symbol.	 If the
	registration information is not available, the address is a
	reference to the native symbol. The default is FALSE which is
	backward compatible, returning just the address of the symbol
	and ignoring registration information.

    o	errorcall and warningcall are now declared in <Rinternals.h>
	(they might be needed in front-ends).

    o	R_FlushConsole and R_ProcessEvents are now declared in <R.h>.

    o	The R_Sock* functions supporting socket connections are no
	longer declared in R-ftp-http.h as they are not loaded into R
	itself, and are now hidden in the module's DLL on suitable systems.


BUG FIXES

    o	Quoted arguments to the R script after --args are now
	passed quoted to the R executable and so will be shown as
	expected by commandArgs().  (They were previously split at
	whitespace even inside quotes on Unix-alikes but not on
	Windows.)

    o	axis() now supports pars 'xaxp'/'yaxp' as inline arguments.

    o	sort() now does not return inappropriate attributes such as
	"dim" and "tsp": it only returns names.

	sort(x, partial=) no longer returns unsorted names, and drops
	names (since it is supplied for efficiency).

    o	Use of non-central F in pf() gives accurate values for larger ncp.

    o	R CMD build --binary does a better job of cleaning up after
	failure to re-make vignettes.

    o	reg-test-1.R tested system(intern=TRUE) which depends on popen
	and so is not supported on all platforms.

    o	Changed apparent mis-spelling of "Gibraltar" in dataset 'eurodist'.

    o	sysconf() is now used to find the number of clock ticks/second:
	under some circumstances glibc reported CLK_TCK = 60 when the
	true value was 100.

    o	identical() was not allowing for embedded nuls in character
	strings. (NB: the comparison operators including == do not,
	and never will.)

    o	The profile() and profiler() methods for "nls" objects now
	support algorithm = "plinear" and algorithm = "port".

    o	The signal handlers for signals USR1 and USR2 where not
	restored if the signal arrived when interrupts were suspended.

    o	Certain combinations of S4 inheritance could cause inherited
	methods to override some directly specified methods.

    o	Some cases of named signatures in calls to setMethod() caused errors.

    o	all.equal() is now more consistent and "picky" about mismatching
	attributes, in particular names(); this is a part of the
	propositions by Andy Piskorkski (PR#8191).

    o	load() when applied to a connection leaves it open/not as it
	found it, and checks explicitly for having a binary readable
	connection.

    o	The p-values given by stat.anova() (called from several
	anova() methods) are now NA (rather than spurious) if
	non-nested models give rise to changes in deviance with a
	different sign from changes in degrees of freedom.

    o	Built-ins were reported as the relevant call in C-level error()s
	iff R profiling was in progress.  Now they are never reported.

    o	Too-long signatures (with no names) were not being caught
	in setMethod().

    o	Slot names in prototype() are being more thoroughly checked.

    o	signif() is more likely to follow the 'round to even' rule for
	exactly representable numbers, e.g. signif(0.25, 1).  (Related
	to PR#8452.)

    o	nls() now works correctly with some low-dimensional fits,
	e.g. with one or zero non-linear parameters.

    o	glm() could give an inappropriate error message if all
	possible coefficients were invalid (e.g. a log-linear binomial
	model with no intercept and a not all positive predictor).

    o	solve() gives clearer error messages for some incorrect usages.
	(PR#8494 and similar)

    o	The gaussian() family was missing the 'valideta' component
	(which could be needed for the "inverse" link function).

	The starting values supplied by the gaussian family could be
	invalid for the "log" and "inverse" link functions.  This is
	now reported.

    o	data.matrix() did not work correctly on zero-row data frames.
	(PR#8496 and other problems.)

    o	The DSC comments in the files from postscript(onefile=FALSE) now
	label all files as having page 1 of 1, as some other software
	seems to expect that.

    o	The axis labels chosen for logarithmic axis are now less
	likely to be linear and inappropriate (when the range is more
	than 10 and less than 100).  (PR#1235)

    o	Staircase lines (types "s" and "S") are now drawn
	continuously rather than a point at a time and so line types,
	mitring and so on work. (PR#2630)

    o	Calling par(mfg) before doing any plotting resulted in NewPage
	never being called on the device, which in turn resulted in
	incorrect output for postcript() and pdf() devices.  (Reported
	by Marc Schwartz in discussion of the non-bug PR#7820.)

    o	terms.formula needed to add parentheses to formulae with
	terms containing '|'.  (PR#8462)

    o	pbirthday() and qbirthday() now also work for very improbable
	events {those you are typically *not* interested in}.

    o	Only source help files starting with an upper- or lower-case
	letter or digit and extension .Rd or .rd are documented to be
	processed.  This is more liberal in that starting with a digit
	is now also allowed, but rule is now enforced.

    o	nls(algorthm="port") was always taking positive numeric
	differences and so could exceed the upper bounds.

    o	methods:::.asEnvironmentPackage() was not allowing for
	versioned installs.

    o	.find.package() now reports which package(s) it cannot find in
	the case it stops with an error.

    o	The standard Unix-alike version of file.show() gives an
	informative message if it cannot open a file rather than the
	(possibly incorrect) 'NO FILE'.

    o	window() did not allow non-overlapping ranges with
	extend = TRUE.  (PR#8545)

    o	pbinom(size = 0) now returns correct values (not NaN).  (PR#8560)

    o	[dp]binom(x, *) for x < 0 now always returns 0. (PR#8700)
	analogous change in pgeom(), pnbinom() and ppois().

    o	[dqpr]geom and [dpqr]nbinom() now all consistently accept prob = 1
	but not prob = 0.  qgeom(prob=1) now gives the correct values
	(not -1).

    o	INSTALL on Unix-alikes was not loading dependent packages when
	preparing for lazy-loading.

    o	qcauchy(1) now gives +Inf instead of just a very large number.

    o	df(0, f1, *) now properly returns Inf, 1, or 0 for f1 < , = , or > 2.

    o	qbinom(), qnbinom() and qpois() now use a better search and
	normally reach the answer very quickly when it is large
	(instead of being slow or infinite-looping).

    o	pt(x, df) lost accuracy in the far tails (when |x| > 1e154) for
	small df (like df = 0.001 for which such extremes are not unlikely).

    o	dbeta(x, a, b) underflowed internally and incorrectly gave 0
	for very small x and a.

    o	None of the warnings about convergence failures or loss of
	precision in nmath (distribution and special functions) were
	being reported to the R user.

    o	dnt was missing from standalone nmath (under Unix-alikes).

    o	split() now accepts factors with numeric (but not storage mode
	integer) codes.

    o	The utilities such as 'check' now report active version numbers
	again, as SVN 'last changed revision' numbers.

    o	addmargins() did not accept a name for 'FUN', only an expression.

    o	'+' for POSIXt objects now takes the tzone from whichever
	object has it, so date+x is the same as x+date if x is numeric.

    o	mean.default() and var() compute means with an additional pass
	and so are often more accurate, e.g. the variance of a
	constant vector is (almost) always zero and the mean of such a
	vector will be equal to the constant value to machine
	precision.  (PR#1228)

	sum(), prod(), mean(), rowSums() and friends use a long double
	accumulator where available and so may be more accurate.  (This
	is particularly helpful on systems such as Sparc and AMD64
	where long double gives considerably greater exponent range
	and precision than double.)

    o	read.dcf() now gives a warning on malformed lines.

    o	add1.[g]lm now try harder to use the environment of the
	formula in the orginal fit to look for objects such as the
	'data' and 'subset' arguments.

    o	gaussian()$aic was inconsistent with e.g. the lm results from
	AIC() and extractAIC() for weighted fits: it treated the weights
	as case weights and not variance factors.

    o	system() on Unix-alikes ignored non-logical values of 'intern' and
	treated 'intern = NA' as true.

    o	as.table() now produces non-NA rownames when converting a
	matrix of more than 26 rows.  (PR#8652)

    o	Partial sorting used an algorithm that was intended only for a
	few values of 'partial' and so could be far slower than a full
	sort.  It now switches to a barebones full sort for more than
	10 values of 'partial' and uses a more efficient recursive
	implementation for 2...10.

    o	summary.glm() returned an estimate of dispersion of Inf for a
	gaussian glm with zero residual degrees of freedom and then
	treated that as a known value.	It now uses the estimate NaN,
	which is consistent with summary.lm().

    o	Sys.sleep() on Unix-alikes was restricted to about 2147 seconds
	and otherwise might never have returned.  (PR#8678)

    o	is(obj, Cl) could wrongly report TRUE when Cl was a classUnion and
	multiple inheritance was involved.

    o	confint[.lm / .default] used label "100 %" for level = 0.999

    o	Empty entries (i.e., extraneous ",") in NAMESPACE files now give
	a better error message early at parsing time instead of a less
	comprehensible one later at load time.

    o	all.equal(n1, n2) could erroneously return NA when n1, n2
	contained large integers.

    o	anova.mlm() didn't handle multi-df effects properly in the
	single-model case (PR#8679)

    o	anova.mlm() had its colnames mangled by data.frame() (needed
	check.names=FALSE).

    o	summary.glm() gave an NA estimate of dispersion for fits with
	zero weights.  (PR#8720)

    o	qhyper() had too small a tolerance for right-continuity on
	some platforms so was not always an inverse to phyper().

    o	rownames<-.data.frame() and dimnames<-.data.frame() tested the
	length(s) of the replacement value(s) before coercion, which
	can change the length (e.g. for class "POSIXlt").

    o	max() and min() ignored the largest/smallest representable
	integer, as well as Inf/-Inf.  (PR#8731)

    o	write.table() assumed factors had integer codes: it now allows
	malformed factors with numeric codes (and otherwise throws an
	error).

    o	Worked around a Solaris restriction which meant that
	Sys.sleep() was only effective for times of up to one second.

    o	sink(, split=TRUE) now works correctly, but is allowed only on
	platforms that support va_copy or __va_copy.  (PR#8716)

    o	factanal(), prcomp() and princomp() now only check that columns
	in the model frame that will be used are numeric (they
	previously also checked columns which were part of negative terms
	in the formula).

    o	Misuse of $ in apply could corrupt memory.  (PR#8718)

    o	apply() could fail if the function returned NULL (e.g. if
	there was a single row).

    o	registerS3method() failed due to a typo. (It was almost never
	used.)

    o	Registering an S3 method for an S3 generic in another package
	that was converted to an S4 generic in the same package as the
	S3 method, registered the method in the wrong place.

    o	Recall() used lookup for the function in use and so could fail
	if that was an S3 method not on the search path.

    o	Rdconv -t Ssgm failed if it encountered \link[opt]{arg}.

    o	uniroot() did not give a warning (as documented) if it failed
	to converge in 'maxiter' steps.	 (PR#8751)

    o	eapply() (and as.list.environment()) did not work for the base
	environment/namespace.  (PR#8761)

    o	Added protection in configure against systems for which using
	xmkmf fails to report a C or C++ compiler.

    o	expand.grid() was constructing a data frame 'by hand' and so
	setting integer row.names (which are documented to be
	character).  It now sets character row names, and
	row.names.data.frame() coerces to character.

    o	qbeta() used == on volatile doubles for its convergence test,
	which failed with gcc 3.3.x on ix86 Linux.  We now use a less
	fragile test (and lose a negligible amount of accuracy).

    o	ls.str() was missing inherits=FALSE, and so could have
	reported on an object of the same name but a different mode in
	the enclosure of the given environment.

    o	logLik.nls assumed that sigma^2 had been estimated, but did
	not count this in the 'df' attribute.

		CHANGES IN R VERSION 2.2.1 patched


INSTALLATION CHANGES


    o	The macro SOCKLEN_T has been replaced by R_SOCKLEN_T to work
	around a problem with the headers of AIX 5.3.


BUG FIXES

    o	sub(fixed = TRUE) could get wrong the length of the character
	string for elements of the result after the first.

    o	legend() worked out which elements of 'lty' were valid before
	resizing 'lty', and so could fail if 'lty' was a different
	length from 'legend'.

    o	str(<dendrogram>) sometimes used much too many spaces (in 2.2.x).

    o	eigen(eispack=TRUE) accessed areas off the matrix in some
	circumstances (some asymmetric matrices with both complex
	conjugate pair and real eigenvalues).

    o	strptime() in 2.2.1 sometimes did not set $isdst when it was
	previously set.

    o	Another case of infinite influence has been worked around.
	(An addendum to PR#8367.)

    o	qr.coef() worked incorrectly with multiple rhs in the
	LAPACK-using cases. (PR#8476/8)

    o	rbind.data.frame() gave a corrupt data frame if one of the
	named arguments was a zero-row data frame. (PR#8506)

    o	Checks for NULL in the rho argument of the C-level findVar
	function have been added.

    o	The C-level substitute function was handling NULL in its 'rho'
	argument incorrectly.

    o	The code for pgamma() introduced in 2.1.0 failed for large
	values of 'shape' where the previous code was perfectly
	acceptable, despite the claim to be uniformly better.  For
	example, pgamma(0.9e100, 1e100) was NaN.  (PR#8528)

    o	There was no command 'ls' in browser() nor 'next' in debug(),
	despite the documentation (which has been corrected).
	Command 'where' in the browser() no longer changes to
	step-though mode.

    o	factor.scope() could report incorrectly that interaction terms
	were not in the upper scope when such terms in the model and
	the upper scope had different orders for the main effects.
	(Another manifestation of PR#7842.)

    o	The "lm" method of drop1() was giving incorrect results for
	weighted fits (since deviance.lm() was called on a non-"lm" object).

    o	dotchart() was miscalculating the space for the labels in the
	left margin.  (PR#8681)

    o	r <- glm(.....); all.equal(r,r) # now gives TRUE instead of an error

    o	plot.acf() with a multiple time series was sometimes
	miscalculating the 'ylim' value for the plot after the first.
	(PR#8705)



		CHANGES IN R VERSION 2.2.1


USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o	options("expressions") has been reduced to 1000: the limit
	of 5000 introduced in 2.1.0 was liable to give crashes from C
	stack overflow.


NEW FEATURES

    o	Use of 'pch' (e.g. in points) in the symbol font 5 is now
	interpreted in the single-byte encoding used by that font.
	Similarly, strwidth now recognizes that font 5 has a different
	encoding from that of the locale.  (These are likely to affect
	the answer only in MBCS locales such as UTF-8.)

    o	The URW font metrics have been updated to versions from late
	2002 which cover more glyphs, including Cyrillic.

    o	New postscript encodings for CP1250 (Windows East European),
	ISO Latin-7 (8859-13, Latvian, Lithuanian and Maori), Cyrillic
	(8859-5), KOI8-R, KOI8-U and CP1251.

    o	configure has more support for the Intel and Portland Group
	compilers on ix86 and x86_64 Linux.

    o	R CMD INSTALL will clean up if interrupted (e.g. by ctrl-C from
	the keyboard).

    o	There is now a comprehensive French translation of the messages,
	thanks to Philippe Grosjean, Frederic Lehobey, Jean Thioulouse
	and Emmanuel Paradis.


DEPRECATED & DEFUNCT

    o	The undocumented use of atan() with two arguments is deprecated:
	instead use atan2() (as documented).

    o	The 'vfont' argument of axis() and mtext() is deprecated
	(it currently warns and does nothing).

    o	The function mauchley.test() is deprecated (was a misspelling)
	and replaced by mauchly.test()


BUG FIXES

    o	The malloc's of AIX and OSF/1 which return NULL for size 0
	are now catered for in src/main/regex.c.

    o	Names of list elements which are missing are now printed as
	$<NA> and not $"NA" (which is how the non-missing name "NA" is
	printed).  (Brought up in discussion of PR#8161.)

    o	help.start() was not linking R.css for use by its front page and
	immediate links (2.2.0 only).

    o	Indexing by character NA matched the name "NA".

    o	The arith-true test used random inputs and did not set the seed, so
	it could fail very occasionally.

    o	arima() with 'fixed' supplied and p=0 for the non-seasonal
	part could give spurious warnings about 'some AR parameters
	were fixed'.

    o	summary.matrix() could give an infinite recursion on some
	classed objects (e.g. those of class "Surv").

    o	The 255th character in an 8-bit character set was not handled
	correctly as a letter on some platforms where C char is
	signed: for example it was printed as \377 and not allowed in
	variable names.	 (Spotted by Alexey Shipunov in Russian
	encodings.)

    o	Conversion from POSIXct to POSIXlt is done more accurately
	around the change of DST in years not supported by the OS
	(pre-1970 on Windows and some others, and in the far past or
	future).

    o	chisq.test(cbind(1:0, c(7,16)), simulate.p = TRUE) gave wrong
	P-values on some platforms. (PR#8224)

    o	pdf() was not writing details of the encoding to the file
	correctly.  (Spotted by Alexey Shipunov in Russian encodings.)

    o	image() was failing with an error when plotting a matrix
	of all NA values.  (PR#8228)

	image() could fail if called with add=FALSE (the default) and
	length(x)=1 for either x or y, as it uses the plot coordinates of
	the previous plot (if any).

    o	tools::checkMD5sums was not accepting file names with spaces in.

    o	The plot() method for TukeyHSD() needed updating after adding
	adjusted p-values.  (PR#8229)

    o	read.fwf() did not work for header = TRUE.  (PR#8226)

    o	diag() failed when its argument had NA values in its dimnames.

    o	[g]sub(pcre=TRUE) did not work correctly with \U and \L in a
	UTF-8 locale, even on the example on the help page.

    o	promptMethods() was failing if the "methods" argument was supplied.

    o	is.loaded() now finds Fortran symbols whether or not the
	registration mechanism has been used.

    o	ISODateTime() mistakenly corrected non-existent times (when
	DST was being started) in the current time zone.

    o	Some replacement operations on data frames gave incorrect
	answers, e.g. DF[3:4, "y"] if column "y" did not exist or was
	a matrix.

    o	getGraphicsEvent() would cause memory corruption if passed an
	empty prompt.

    o	qr() and chol() now pivot the colnames of the result when
	pivoting is used.  (PR#8258)

    o	example(points) omitted pch=0, although it was valid and
	said in the text to be illustrated.

    o	plot.default() had an unused 'lab' argument, thereby preventing
	the 'lab' graphics parameter being passed through '...' .

    o	Although polygon(col = NA) was the stated default, specifying
	NA was not equivalent to omitting the argument (but col=NULL
	was equivalent).

    o	Im(-1) was pi. (PR#8272, a side effect from all previous
	versions of R returning the same value for Im and Arg of
	non-complex numbers.)

    o	symbols(fg) defaulted to colour 1, not par("col") as documented.
	It does now defaults to par("col").

    o	par("family") did not check the length of the value (up to 49
	bytes) and so could segfault.

    o	aggregate.ts() did not allow for rounding in frequencies such
	as 1/5.

    o	prcomp(tol=) was not dropping the sdev's corresponding to
	dropped columns.

    o	Subassignment of a vector which increased the length of the
	vector _and_ had the wrong length of replacement could
	occasionally segfault.  (This has been there since at least
	mid 1997.)

    o	The registration of .Fortran symbols was broken: these could
	only be looked up if there were also .Call symbols registered!

    o	R CMD build was incorrectly rejecting the recommended form of
	name for a translation package, 'Translation-ll'.  (PR#8314)

    o	numericDeriv() gave nonsense results unless the variables were
	real, which was not checked.

    o	predict.prcomp() would sometimes give an error when predicting
	a single observation.  (PR#8324)

    o	mapply() could segfault if MoreArgs was not a list.  (PR#8332)

    o	The arith-true test used identical() on floating-point results,
	and this allowed a failure when the relative difference was
	less than .Machine$double.eps but non-zero.

    o	qbinom() was not accepting p = -Inf when log.p = TRUE, although
	it is a legitimate value.

    o	write.csv[2] only accepted logical constants for 'row.names', and
	now accepts variables.

    o	Conversion of .Rd files did not correctly match braces
	enclosing a whole argument, e.g. \eqn{{\bf a}}{a}.

    o	The C function pythag (used if hypot was not available) would
	infinite-loop on systems with effective optimizing compilers.

    o	Writing long formats (more than 1000 bytes) with connections
	that use dummy_vfprintf could fail on some systems.  The limit
	has been changed to 100000 bytes pending a more complete fix in R
	2.3.0.

    o	Making in src/nmath/standalone without making R was not
	making Rmath.h.

    o	Both the R front-end and INSTALL could find the attempted
	temporary directory name already in use on platforms without
	mktemp (and a genuine Bourne shell /bin/sh, not bash).	Now
	both the process ID and a timestamp are used to create the
	directory name.

    o	[dpqr]gamma now return NaN for an invalid 'shape' parameter
	(rather than throw an error), for consistency with other
	distribution functions.

    o	t() now longer drops dimnames 'list(NULL,NULL)' or 'list(NULL)'.

    o	Influence measures such as rstandard() and cooks.distance()
	could return infinite values rather than NaN for a case which
	was fitted exactly.  Similarly, plot.lm() could fail on such
	examples.  plot.lm(which = 5)  had to be modified to only plot
	cases with hat < 1.  (PR#8367)

	lm.influence() was incorrectly reporting 'coefficients' and
	'sigma' as NaN for cases with hat = 1, and on some platforms
	not detecting hat = 1 correctly.

    o	Rmath.h for standalone Rmath was not recording HAVE_WORKING_LOG,
	so R_log was not available on platforms defining it.

    o	HoltWinters() was using a slightly incorrect formula in the C code.

    o	dir.create() could be confused by a trailing slash on the
	path, and by paths containing drives on Windows.

    o	The search for tcl/tkConfig.sh looked in 'lib' before 'lib64'
	directories (and not at all in /usr/local/lib64) and so might
	prefer 32- to 64-bit versions if both are available.

    o	nlminb() used an uninitialized variable unless bounds were supplied,
	and so failed on 64-bit Solaris.



		CHANGES IN R VERSION 2.2.0


USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o	plot(<lm object>) uses a new default 'which = 5'
	for the fourth panel when 'which' is not specified.

    o	The SVN revision number will appear after the date in the
	welcome message.  The date shown is now the date of the last
	change to the sources rather than the date the sources were
	prepared.

    o	is.null(expression()) now returns FALSE.  Only NULL gives TRUE
	in is.null().

    o	graphics::xy.coords, xyz.coords and n2mfrow have been moved to
	the grDevices name space (to be available for grid as well).

	graphics::boxplot.stats, contourLines, nclass.*, and chull
	have been moved to the grDevices name space.  The C code
	underlying chull() has been moved to package grDevices.

    o	split(x, f), split<-() and unsplit() now by default split by all
	levels of a factor f, even when some are empty.
	Use split(x, f, drop = TRUE) if you want the old behavior of
	dropping empty levels.	split() and split<-() are S3 generic
	functions with new arguments 'drop' and '...' and all methods now
	should have 'drop' and '...' arguments as well.

    o	The default for 'allowEscapes' in both read.table() and scan()
	has been changed to FALSE.

    o	The default for 'gcFirst' in system.time() is now TRUE.


NEW FEATURES

    o	.Platform has a new component 'path.sep', the separator used
	between paths in environment variables such as PATH and TEXINPUTS.

    o	anova.mlm() now handles the single-model case.

    o	Hexadecimal values are now allowed for as.numeric() and
	as.integer() on all platforms, and as integer constants in R code.

    o	attach() now prints an information message when objects are
	masked on the search path by or from a newly attached database.

    o	axis() now returns 'at' positions.

    o	axis() has a new argument 'hadj' to control horizontal
	adjustment of labels.

    o	axis.Date() and axis.POSIXct() now accept a 'labels' argument
	(contributed by Gavin Simpson).

    o	barplot() now has arguments 'log = ""' and 'add = FALSE'
	(as in barplot2() from package 'gplots').

    o	baseenv() has been added, to return the base environment.  This
	is currently still NULL, but will change in a future release.

    o	boxplot() now responds to supplying 'yaxs' (via bxp()).
	(Wish of PR#8072.)

    o	capabilities() has a new component 'NLS'.

    o	cbind() and rbind() now react to 'deparse.level' = {0,1,2}
	(as in another system not unlike R).

    o	Experimental versions of cbind() and rbind() in methods package,
	based on new generic function cbind2(x,y) and rbind2().	 This will
	allow the equivalent of S4 methods for cbind() and rbind() ---
	currently only after an explicit activation call, see ?cbind2.

    o	New functions cdplot() and spineplot() for conditional density
	plots and spine plots or spinograms.  Spine plots are now used
	instead of bar plots for x-y scatterplots where y is a factor.

    o	checkDocFiles() in package 'tools' now checks for bad \usage
	lines (syntactically invalid R code).

    o	The nonparametric variants of cor.test() now behave better in
	the presence of ties. The "spearman" method uses the asymptotic
	approximation in that case, and the "kendall" method likewise,
	but adds a correction for ties (this is not necessary in the
	Spearman case).

    o	The X11 dataentry() now has support for X Input Methods
	(contributed by Ei-ji Nakama).

    o	density() is now an S3 generic where density.default() {former
	density()} has new argument 'weights' for specifying observation
	masses different than the default 1/N -- based on a suggestion and
	code from Adrian Baddeley.

    o	download.packages() now carries on if it encounters a download
	error (e.g. a repository with a corrupt index).

    o	dump() now skips missing objects with a warning rather than
	throw an error.

    o	Added "POSIXlt" methods for duplicated() and unique().

    o	Function encoded_text_to_latex() in package tools translates
	Latin 1,2,9 and UTF-8 encoded character vectors to LaTeX
	escape sequences where appropriate.

    o	encodeString() allows justify = "none" for consistency with
	format.default().  Some argument names have been lengthened
	for clarity.

    o	file(), fifo() and pipe() now (if possible) report a reason
	if they fail to open a connection.

    o	format.default() now has a 'width' argument, and 'justify' can
	now centre character strings.

	format.default() has new arguments 'na.encode' to control
	whether NA character strings are encoded (true by default),
	and 'scientific' to control the use of fixed/scientific
	notation for real/complex numbers.

	How format() works on a list is now documented, and uses
	arguments consistently with their usage on an atomic vector.

    o	format.info() now has a 'digits' argument, and is documented
	to work for all atomic vectors (it used to work for all but
	raw vectors.).

    o	New function glob2rx() for translating `wildcard' aka `globbing'
	to regular expressions.

    o	There is a new function gregexpr() which generalizes regexpr()
	to search for all matches in each of the input strings (not
	just the first match).

    o	[g]sub() now have a 'useBytes' argument like grep() and regexpr().

    o	[g]sub(perl = TRUE) support \L and \U in the replacement.

    o	iconv() has been moved from 'utils' to 'base'.

    o	identify()'s default method has additional arguments 'atpen'
	and 'tolerance' (following S).

    o	KalmanForecast() and KalmanLike() now have an optional argument
	fast=FALSE to prevent their arguments being modified.

    o	Exact p-values are available in ks.test() for the one-sided and
	two-sided one-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests.

    o	labels() now has a method for "dist" objects (replacing that
	for names() which was withdrawn in 2.1.0).

    o	library() now explicitly checks for the existence of
	directories in 'lib.loc': this avoids some warning messages.

    o	loadNamespace(keep.source=) now applies only to that namespace
	and not others it might load to satisfy imports: this is now
	consistent with library().

    o	match.arg() has a new argument 'several.ok = FALSE'.

    o	max.col() has a new argument for non-random behavior in the
	case of ties.

    o	memory.profile() now uses the type names returned by typeof()
	and no longer has two unlabelled entries.

    o	methods() now warns if it appears to have been called on a
	non-generic function.

    o	The default mosaicplot() method by default draws grey boxes.

    o	nlminb(), similar to that in S-PLUS, added to package 'stats'.

    o	New algorithm "port" (the nl2sol algorithm available in the
	Port library on netlib) added to the nls() function in the
	'stats' package.

    o	object.size() now supports more types, including external
	pointers and weak references.

    o	options() now returns its result in alphabetical order, and is
	documented more comprehensively and accurately.	 (Now all
	options used in base R are documented, including
	platform-specific ones.)

	Some options are now set in the package which makes use of
	them (grDevices, stats or utils) if not already set when the
	package is loaded.

    o	New option("OutDec") to set the decimal point for output conversions.

    o	New option("add.smooth") to add smoothers to a plot, currently
	only used by plot.lm().

    o	pie() has new optional arguments 'clockwise' and 'init.angle'.

    o	plot.lm() has two new plots (for 'which' = 5 or 6), plotting
	residuals or cook distances versus (transformed) leverages - unless
	these are constant.  Further, the new argument 'add.smooth' adds a
	loess smoother to the point plots by default, and 'qqline = TRUE'
	adds a qqline() to the normal plot.
	The default for 'sub.caption' has been improved for long calls.

    o	R.home() has been expanded to return the paths to components
	(which can as from this version be installed elsewhere).

    o	readbin() and writeBin() now support raw vectors as well as
	filenames and connections.

    o	read.dcf() can now read gzipped files.

    o	read.table() now passes 'allowEscapes' to scan().

    o	sample(x, size, prob, replace = TRUE) now uses a faster
	algorithm if there are many reasonably probable values.	 (This
	does mean the results will be different from earlier versions
	of R.)	The speedup is modest unless 'x' is very large _and_
	'prob' is very diffuse so that thousands of distinct values
	will be generated with an appreciable frequency.

    o	scatter.smooth() now works a bit more like other plotting
	functions (e.g., accepts a data frame for argument 'x').
	Improvements suggested by Kevin Wright.

    o	signif() on complex numbers now rounds jointly to give the
	requested number of digits in the larger component, not
	independently for each component.

    o	New generic function simulate() in the 'stats' package with
	methods for some classes of fitted models.

    o	smooth.spline() has a new argument 'keep.data' which allows to
	provide residuals() and fitted() methods for smoothing splines.

    o	Attempting source(file, chdir=TRUE) with a URL or connection
	for 'file' now gives a warning and ignores 'chdir'.

    o	source() closes its input file after parsing it rather than
	after executing the commands, as used to happen prior to
	2.1.0.  (This is probably only significant on Windows where
	the file is locked for a much shorter time.)

    o	split(), split<-(), unsplit() now have a new argument 'drop = FALSE',
	by default not dropping empty levels; this is *not* back compatible.

    o	sprintf() now supports asterisk `*' width or precision
	specification (but not both) as well as `*1$' to `*99$'.  Also the
	handling of `%' as conversion specification terminator is now
	left to the system and doesn't affect following specifications.

    o	The plot method for stl() now allows the colour of the range
	bars to be set (default unchanged at "light gray").

    o	Added tclServiceMode() function to the tcltk package to allow
	updating to be suspended.

    o	terms.formula() no longer allows '.' in a formula unless there
	is a (non-empty) 'data' argument or 'allowDotAsName = TRUE' is
	supplied.  We have found several cases where 'data' had not
	been passed down to terms() and so '.' was interpreted as a
	single variable leading to incorrect results.

    o	New functions trans3d(), the 3D -> 2D utility from persp()'s
	example, and extendrange(), both in package 'grDevices'.

    o	TukeyHSD() now returns p-values adjusted for multiple comparisons
	(based on a patch contributed by Fernando Henrique Ferraz P. da Rosa).

    o	New functions URLencode() and URLdecode(), particularly for use
	with file:// URLs.  These are used by e.g. browse.env(),
	download.file(), download.packages() and various help() print
	methods.

    o	Functions utf8ToInt() and intToUtf8() to work with UTF-8
	encoded character strings (irrespective of locale or OS-level
	UTF-8 support).

    o	[dqp]wilcox and wilcox.test work better with one very large sample
	size and an extreme first argument.

    o	write() has a new argument 'sep'.

    o	write.csv[2] now also support row.names = FALSE.



    o	The specification of the substitutions done when processing
	Renviron files is more liberal: see ?Startup.  It now
	accepts forms like R_LIBS=${HOME}/Rlibrary:${WORKGRP}/R/lib .

    o	Added recommendation that packages have an overview man page
	<pkg>-package.Rd, and the promptPackage() function to create a
	skeleton version.

    o	Replacement indexing of a data frame by a logical matrix index
	containing NAs is allowed in a few more cases, in particular
	always when the replacement value has length one.

    o	Conversion of .Rd files to latex now handles encoding more
	comprehensively, including some support for UTF-8.

    o	The internal regex code has been upgraded to glibc-2.3.5.
	Apart from a number of bug fixes, this should be somewhat
	faster, especially in UTF-8 locales.

    o	PCRE has been updated to version 6.2.

    o	zlib has been updated to version 1.2.3.

    o	bzip2 has been updated to version 1.0.3.

    o	Complex arithmetic is now done by C99 complex types where
	supported.  This is likely to boost performance, but is
	subject to the accuracy with which it has been implemented.

    o	The printing of complex numbers has changed, handling numbers
	as a whole rather than in two parts.  So both real and
	imaginary parts are shown to the same accuracy, with the
	'digits' parameter referring to the accuracy of the larger
	component, and both components are shown in fixed or
	scientific notation (unless one is entirely zero when it is
	always shown in fixed notation).

    o	Error messages from .C() and .Fortran(), and from parsing errors,
	are now more informative.

    o	The date and date-time functions work better with dates more
	than 5000 years away from 1970-01-01 (by making dubious
	assumptions about the calendar in use).

    o	There is now a traditional Chinese translation, and a much more
	extensive Russian translation.


DEPRECATED & DEFUNCT

    o	Capability "IEEE754" is defunct.

    o	loadURL() is defunct: use load(url()).

    o	delay() is defunct: use delayedAssign() instead.

    o	The 'CRAN' argument to update.packages(), old.packages(),
	new.packages(), download.packages() and install.packages() is
	defunct in favour of 'repos'.

    o	write.table0() is deprecated in favour of the much faster
	write.table().

    o	format.char() is deprecated in favour of format.default().

    o	R_HOME/etc/Rprofile is no longer looked for if
	R_HOME/etc/Rprofile.site does not exist.  (This has been
	undocumented since R 1.4.0.)

    o	CRAN.packages() is deprecated in favour of available.packages().

    o	Rd.sty no longer processes pre-2.0.0 conversions containing \Link.

    o	The stubs for the defunct device GNOME/gnome have been removed.

    o	print.matrix() (which has been identical to print.default since
	R 1.7.0) has been removed.


INSTALLATION

    o	LDFLAGS now defaults to -L/usr/local/lib64 on most Linux
	64-bit OSes (but not ia64).  The use of lib/lib64 can be
	overridden by the new variable LIBnn.

    o	The default installation directory is now ${prefix}/${LIBnn}/R,
	/usr/local/lib64/R on most 64-bit Linux OSes and /usr/local/lib/R
	elsewhere.

    o	The places where the doc, include and share directory trees are
	installed can be specified independently: see the R-admin manual.

    o	We now test for wctrans_t, as apparently some broken OSes have
	wctrans but not wctrans_t (which is required by the relevant
	standards) .

    o	Any external BLAS found is now tested to see if the complex
	routine zdotu works correctly: this provides a compatibility
	test of compiler return conventions.

    o	Installation without NLS is now cleaner, and does not install
	any message catalogues.

    o	src/modules/lapack/dlamc.f is now compiled with -ffloat-store
	if f2c/gcc are used, as well as if g77 is used.

    o	All the Fortran code has been checked to be fully F77
	compliant so there are no longer any warnings from F95
	compilers such as gfortran.

    o	The (not-recommended) options --with-system-zlib,
	--with-system-bzlib and -with-system-pcre now have 'system' in
	the name.

    o	If a Java runtime environment is detected at configure time
	its library path is appended to LD_LIBRARY_PATH or equivalent.
	New Java-related variables JAVA_HOME (path to JRE/JDK), JAVA_PROG
	(path to Java interpreter), JAVA_LD_PATH (Java library path)
	and JAVA_LIBS (flags to link against JNI) are made available
	in Makeconf.

    o	Ei-ji Nakama was contributed a patch for FPU control with the
	Intel compilers on ix86 Linux.


MAC OS X INSTALLATION

    o	--with-blas="-framework vecLib" --with-lapack and
	--with-aqua are now the default configure options.

    o	The default framework version name was changed to not contain
	the patch level (i.e. it is now 2.2 instead of 2.2.0).	Also
	it can be overridden at configure time by setting FW_VERSION
	to the desired name.

    o	The Rmath stand-alone library is now correctly installed inside
	the R.framework if R was configured as a framework.  In
	addition, make install-Rmath-framework will install a
	stand-alone Rmath framework in /Library/Frameworks (unless
	overridden by RMATH_FRAMEWORK_DIR specifying full framework
	path and name including the .framework extension).


PACKAGE INSTALLATION

    o	The encoding for a packages' 00Index.html is chosen from the
	Encoding: field (if any) of the DESCRIPTION file and from the
	\encoding{} fields of any Rd files with non-ASCII titles.
	If there are conflicts, first-found wins with a warning.

    o	R_HOME/doc/html/packages.html is now remade by R not Perl code.
	This may result in small changes in layout and a change in
	encoding (to UTF-8 where supported).

    o	The return value of new.packages() is now updated for any
	packages which may be installed.

    o	available.packages() will read a compressed PACKAGES.gz file in
	preference to PACKAGES if available on the repository: this
	will reduce considerably the download time on a dialup connection.

	The downloaded information about a repository is cached for the
	current R session.

    o	The information about library trees found by
	installed.packages() is cached for the current session, and
	updated only if the modification date of the top-level
	directory has been changed.

    o	A data index is now installed for a package with a 'data' dir
	but no 'man' dir (even though it will have undocumented data objects).

    o	contrib.url path for type="mac.binary" has changed from
	bin/macosx/<version> to	bin/macosx/<arch>/contrib/<version>
	where <arch> corresponds to R.version$arch


UTILITIES

    o	checkFF() used by R CMD check has since R 2.0.0 not reported
	missing PACKAGE arguments when testing installed packages with
	namespaces.  It now

	- treats installed and source packages in the same way.

	- reports missing arguments unless they are in a function in
	  the namespace with a useDynLib declaration (as the
	  appropriate DLL for such calls can be searched for).

    o	Rd2dvi sets the encoding(s) used appropriately.	 If UTF-8
	encoding is used, latex >= 2003/12/01 is required.

    o	codoc() allows help files named pkg_name-defunct.Rd to have
	undocumented arguments (and not just base-defunct.Rd).


C-LEVEL FACILITIES

    o	C function massdist() {called from density()} has new argument
	'xmass' (= weights).

    o	Raw vectors passed to .C() are now passed as unsigned char *
	rather than as SEXPs.  (Wish of Keith Frost, PR#7853)

    o	The search for symbols in a .C/.Call/... call without a
	package argument now searches for an enclosing namespace and
	so finds functions defined within functions in a namespace.

    o	R_max_col() has new (5th) argument '*ties_meth' allowing
	non-random behavior in the case of ties.

    o	The header files have been rationalized: the BLAS routine
	LSAME is now declared in BLAS.h not Linpack.h, Applic.h no
	longer duplicates routines from Linpack.h, and Applic.h is
	divided into API and non-API sections.

    o	memory.c has been instrumented so that Valgrind can track R's
	internal memory management.  To use this, configure using
	       --with-valgrind-instrumentation=level
	where level is 1 or 2.	Both levels will find more bugs with
	gctorture(TRUE).  Level 2 makes Valgrind run extremely slowly.

    o	Some support for raw vectors has been added to Rdefines.h.

    o	R_BaseEnv has been added, to refer to the base environment.
	This is currently equal to R_NilValue, but it will change in
	a future release.


BUG FIXES

    o	%/% has been adjusted to make x == (x %% y) + y * ( x %/% y )
	more likely in cases when extended-precision registers were
	interfering.

    o	Operations on POSIXct objects (such as seq(), max() and
	subsetting) try harder to preserve time zones and warn if
	inconsistent time zones are used.

    o	as.function.default() no longer asks for a bug report when
	given an invalid body. (PR#1880, PR#7535, PR#7702)

    o	Hershey fonts and grid output (and therefore lattice output)
	now rescale correctly in fit-to-window resizing on a Windows
	graphics device.  Line widths also scale now.

    o	Plotmath has more support for multibyte characters (contributed
	by Ei-ji Nakama).

    o	The X11() device now hints the window manager so that decorations
	appear reliably under e.g. the GNOME WM	 (contributed
	by Ei-ji Nakama).

    o	Subsetting a matrix or an array as a vector used to attempt to
	use the row names to name the result, even though the
	array might be longer than the row names.  Now this is only
	done for 1D arrays when it is done in all cases, even matrix
	indexing.  (Tidies up after the fix to PR#937.)

    o	Constants in mathlib are declared 'const static double' to
	avoid performance issues with the Intel Itanium compiler.

    o	The parser checks the format of numeric constants more
	thoroughly so for example '123E-' is no longer valid.

    o	contourLines() no longer requires an open device (used to
	start a device unnecessarily).	Fix suggested by Barry Rowlingson.

    o	capabilities() used partial matching but was not documented
	to: it no longer does so.

    o	kernel(1,0) printed wrongly;  kernel(<name-string>, *) now returns
	a named kernel in all cases; plot(kernel(.),..) is more flexible.

    o	qgamma(1,s) didn't give +Inf for some s.

    o	installed.packages() and download.packages() now always
	return a matrix as documented, possibly with 0 rows (rather than
	a 0-length character vector or NULL).

    o	Arithmetic operations on data frames no longer coerce the
	names to syntatically valid names.

    o	Units are now properly recycled in grid layouts
	when 'widths' or 'heights' are shorter than the number of
	columns or rows (PR#8014).

    o	DF <- data.frame(A=1:2, B=3:4); DF[1, 1:3] <- NULL gave a wrong
	error message.

    o	spline()/spinefun()'s C code had a memory access buglet which
	never lead to incorrect results.  (PR#8030)

    o	sum() was promoting logical arguments to double not integer
	(as min() and other members of its group do).

    o	loess() had a bug causing it to occasionally miscalculate
	standard errors (PR#7956).  Reported by Benjamin Tyner, fixed
	by Berwin Turlach.

    o	library(keep.source=) was ignored if the package had a
	namespace (the setting of options("keep.source.pkgs") was
	always used).

    o	hist.POSIXct() and hist.Date() now respect par("xaxt").

    o	The 'vfont' argument was not supported correctly in title(),
	mtext(), and axis().  The 'vfont' argument is superseded by
	the par(family=) approach introduced in 2.0.0.	This bug-fix
	just updates the warning messages and documentation to
	properly reflect the new order of things.

    o	The C-level function PrintGenericVector could overflow if
	asked to print a length-1 character vector of several thousand
	characters.  This could happen when printing a list matrix,
	and was fatal up to 2.1.1 and silently truncated in 2.1.1 patched.

    o	What happened for proc.time() and system.time() on
	(Unix-alike) systems which do not support timing was
	incorrectly documented.	 (They both exist but throw an error.)
	Further, systen.time() would give an error in its on.exit
	expression.

    o	weighted.residuals() now does sensible things for glm() fits:
	in particular it now agrees with an lm() fit for a Gaussian glm()
	fit.  (PR#7961).

    o	The 'lm' and 'glm' methods for add1() took the weights and
	offset from the original fit, and so gave errors in the
	(dubious) usage where the upper scope resulted in a smaller
	number of cases to fit (e.g. by omitting missing values in new
	variables).  (PR#8049)

    o	demo() had a 'device' argument that did nothing (although it
	was documented to): it has been removed.

    o	Setting new levels on a factor dropped all existing
	attributes, including class "ordered".

    o	format.default(justify="none") now by default converts NA
	character strings, as the other values always did.

    o	format.info() often gave a different field width from format()
	for character vectors (e.g. including missing values or
	non-printable characters).

    o	axis() now ensures that if 'labels' are supplied as character
	strings or expressions then 'at' is also supplied (since the
	calculated value for 'at' can change under resizing).

    o	Defining S4 methods for "[" had resulted in changed behavior of S3
	dispatch in a very rare case which no longer happens.

    o	Fixed segfault when PostScript font loading fails, e.g., when
	R is unable to find afm files (reported by Ivo Welch).

    o	R CMD BATCH <file> now also works when <file> does not end in a
	newline on Unix-alike platforms.

    o	terms.formula() got confused if the 'data' argument was a list with
	non-syntactic names.

    o	prompt() and hence package.skeleton() now produce *.Rd files that
	give no errors (but warnings) when not edited, much more often.

    o	promptClass() and promptMethods() now also escape "%" e.g. in '%*%'
	and the latter gives a message about the file written.

    o	wilcox.test() now warns when conf.level is set higher than
	achievable, preventing errors (PR#3666) and incorrect answers
	with extremely small sample sizes.

    o	The default (protection pointer) stack size (the default for
	'--max-ppsize') has been increased from 10000 to 50000 in order to
	match the increased default options("expressions") (in R 2.1.0).

    o	The R front-end was expecting --gui=tk not Tk as documented,
	and rejecting --gui=X11.

    o	Rdconv -t latex protected only the first << and >> in a chunk
	against conversion to guillemets.

    o	callNextMethod() and callGeneric() have fixes related to
	handling arguments.

    o	ls.diag() now works for fits with missing data. (PR#8139)

    o	window.default() had an incorrect tolerance and so sometimes
	created too short a series if 'start' or 'end' were zero.

    o	Some (fairly pointless) cases of reshape left a
	temporary id variable in the result (PR#8152)

    o	R CMD build used 'tar xhf' which is invalid on FreeBSD systems
	(and followed tar chf, so there could be no symbolic links in
	the tarball).

    o	Subassignment of length zero vectors to NULL gave garbage
	answers. (PR#8157)

    o	Automatic coercion of raw vectors to lists was missing, so for a
	list (or data frame) z, z[["a"]] <- raw_vector did not work
	and now does.  This also affected DF$a <- raw_vector for a
	data frame DF.

    o	The internal code for commandArgs() was missing PROTECTs.

    o	The width for strwrap() was used as one less than specified.

    o	R CMD INSTALL was not cleaning up after an unsuccessful
	install of a non-bundle which was not already installed.

		CHANGES IN R VERSION 2.1.1 patched


BUG FIXES

    o	runmed(x, k = -1) now gives an error instead of a seg.fault.

    o	File creation errors in pdf(), postscript(), xfig() resulted
	in a pointer being freed twice.	 (Reported by Matt McCall)

    o	model.matrix(~ .^2, data=foo) now works as most people would
	expect (it used to expand '.' after using the a^2 = a rule).

    o	ftable() and xtabs() had a check for interactions that would
	not work correctly with '.' in the formula.

    o	The formula method for pairs() was ignoring the na.action argument.

    o	scan() with the default separator (only) was stripping backslashes
	inside quoted string inputs even if allowEscapes = FALSE.

    o	The "col" parameter to pairs() is now treated consistently with
	plot():	 it affects the data, not the axes.  (Patch submitted
	by Olaf Mersmann)

    o	Sweave failed for \Sexpr{character(0)}.	 Sweave-test-1.Rnw
	contained a print() statement that is no longer needed.

    o	Typo meant that R_alloc was limited to 2^31 not 2^34 on 64-bit
	builds of R.

    o	pgamma(Inf, shape) did not terminate for shape = 1.1 and some
	other values (but not all) (PR#8001).  This affected
	pchisq(Inf, df1) and pf(Inf, df1, Inf) for some values of df1.

    o	regexpr("[a-z]", ...) could cause a buffer overrun with multi-byte
	character sets, leading to random errors later.

    o	Installing a package with a 'data' directory which contains
	files but those files generate no objects (e.g. the BioC
	package	makecdfenv) created an incorrectly formatted data
	index that data(package="pkg") could not read.

    o	density(1/(0:2)) now works again (PR#8033).

    o	make.names() was not respecting the allow_=FALSE argument.

    o	Arg(-1) now gives pi, not 0; Arg(0i + -1) always worked.

    o	--enable-linux-lfs had been broken at 2.1.0.

    o	Printing was not allowing for double-width characters in its
	layout.

    o	axTicks() is now also correct for reverse axis.	 (PR#7973)

    o	signif() rounded some numnbers near 1e-308 to the wrong
	number of places (this showed up in the print-tests.R), and made
	unnecessary rounding errors on some platforms on e.g. signif(18000, 3).

    o	window() was sometimes failing incorrectly due to representation
	errors when the new and old deltat were not both integers
	(e.g. multiples of 0.1).

    o	The 'lm' methods for add1() and drop1() ignored offsets (which
	were added for lm() after they written).  (PR#8049)

    o	atan2(0+1i, 0+0i) was incorrectly NA (from a typo in complex.c).

    o	The POSIXct method for as.Date() was rounding part days
	before 1970-01-01 upwards rather than discarding them.

    o	qpois() was using an incorrect starting point and so could be
	unnecessarily slow for large lambda.  (PR#8058)

    o	Formatting of complex numbers with nsmall > 0 could be
	incorrect (and was in print-tests.Rout) because of a typo.

    o	The test for new levels when predicting using model.frame()
	sometimes reported levels that were not actually used.

    o	order(c("5","6",NA,"4",NA), na.last=FALSE) was incorrect.

    o	Coercion to raw could give spurious messages about discarding
	imaginary parts.

	Coercion of a list to raw was behaving inconsistently for
	out-of-range values (and not warning).

    o	cor.test(method = "spearman") gave NA p-values for _very_ long
	vectors. (PR#8087)

    o	Switching to the Mersenne-Twister RNG could cause a segfault on
	first use.

	A user-supplied RNG without user_unif_{nseed,seedloc} was
	being re-initialized at each call.

    o	Reading very short tables from stdin() with read.table would
	fail because of a typo.




		CHANGES IN R VERSION 2.1.1


NEW FEATURES

    o	bug.report() now reports the locale in use.

    o	upgrade.packageStatus() allows user input "c" to cancel the
	upgrade, just as update.packages() does.

    o	glm() now accepts 1D arrays (e.g. tables) as a response,
	dropping them to a vector whilst preserving names.

    o	df() with one infinite df now works (to match pf()).

    o	Added tclServiceMode() function to the tcltk package to allow
	updating to be suspended.

    o	The Encoding: field of a DESCRIPTION file is now documented,
	and used by packageDescription() and library(help=).

    o	There has been progress on translations: existing translations
	have been revised and expanded, and French and Korean have
	been added.

	The Windows installer supports a wide range of languages for
	installation.


BUG FIXES

    o	lm(qr=FALSE) now works.

    o	predict.glm() not longer loses names for "response" predictions.
	(PR#7792)

    o	Typo in menu(graphics=TRUE) meant it failed on Unix if tcltk
	was not available.

    o	When names.dist() was removed, the result of cmdscale() lost
	its rownames.  The example also lost the labels.

    o	R CMD check assumed 'tar' was GNU tar and so supported -z.

    o	read.table() was not handing escaped quotes inside quoted fields
	in the first five lines of the file.  (PR#7789)

	It was also not handling correctly EOF in the first five lines
	when reading from stdin().  (PR#7772)

    o	'make uninstall' was incomplete.

    o	make.packages.html() called by help.start() was failing if
	there were installed packages with help titles invalid in the
	current locale.

    o	printCoefmat(signif.legend = FALSE) was non-functional. (PR#7802)

    o	Some as.date.frame() methods failed because the expression
	deparsed into multiple lines. (PR#7808)

    o	setRepositories() had a typo. (PR#7810)

    o	Printing arrays/data frames with multibyte characters in the
	column labels was sometimes misaligned or using excessive space.
	(PR#7803)

    o	The Tcl/Tk console did not support multibyte characters.

    o	as.POSIXlt() could give infinite recursion if passed a corrupt
	"POSIXct" object (generated by an incorrect call to c.POSIXct,
	PR#7826).

    o	update.packages() was not passing 'type' correctly to
	install.packages().

    o	Printing the result of an unbalanced model.tables() call
	sometimes got confused if terms() had rearranged interaction
	terms.  (PR#7829)

    o	.Platform$pkgType was wrong on the CRAN MacOS X build, and
	.install.macbinary() was missing.

    o	as.personList() as used by citation() got confused by names
	containing "and".  (PR#7797)

    o	Subscripting an array by a matrix containing zero or negative
	values or the wrong number of columns was not handled
	consistently. (PR#7824)

    o	select.list(multiple=TRUE) now detects and tries again for invalid
	text input.

    o	add1.[g]lm could give strange results with interaction terms
	when the model and the upper scope had different orders for
	the main effects.  (PR#7842)

    o	A bug had sneaked into the anova.mlmlist() code, affecting the
	Greenhouse-Geisser epsilon. Code wrongly assumed a matrix to
	be symmetric. (Thanks to Bela Bauer.)

    o	anova.mlmlist() and mauchley.test() are now more tolerant to rank
	deficiency in the M and X matrices (also when they are implicitly
	generated via model.matrix()).

    o	anova.mlm had a scoping issue (PR#7898)

    o	pf() with infinite df is allowed again.	 It is now more accurate
	for extreme ratios of dfs, especially when there is a
	non-centrality parameter.

    o	df() was inaccurate for large df (1e16 or greater).

    o	dt() was inaccurate for large df (1e9 or greater) with a
	non-centrality parameter.

    o	runmed(*, algorithm="Turlach") seg.faulted in rare cases.

    o	strwrap() now makes a reasonable job of text that is invalid in the
	current locale.

    o	Reading with encoding "UCS-2LE" will remove any Byte Order
	Mark, as most implementations of iconv fail to handle BOMs
	(which are present in 'Windows Unicode' files).

    o	unique() for a list was incorrectly reporting `unimplemented'.

    o	The parser's contextstack was not protected against overflow,
	e.g. more than 50 unmatched '('.  (PR#7859)

    o	source(file, chdir = TRUE) was not checking that 'file' was a
	filepath (rather than a URL).  For 2.1.0 only, it did not work
	even if 'file' was a filepath.

    o	Hershey fonts were being sized based on pixels not points so came
	out too small on devices where pixels were noticeably different
	from points (e.g., win.printer() and high-resolution screens).

	Fix means that default size of Hershey fonts may be slightly
	different, for example, smaller by default on PostScript and PDF.

    o	The branch cuts in the complex versions of the inverse
	trigonometric and hyperbolic functions were non-standard.
	(PR#7871)

    o	truncate() on file() connections was limited to files < 2Gb.  It
	now works for larger files at least on 64-bit OSes and others
	where ftruncate supports such files.  (Related to PR#7879)

    o	proj.aovlist() did not work correctly on objects fitted from a
	data frame with row names.

    o	The coding standards recommendations had
	nuke-trailing-whitespace where newer versions of ESS need
	ess-nuke-trailing-whitespace.  (PR#7888)

    o	package.skeleton() missed the first newline in the DESCRIPTION file.

    o	pbirthday() reported p = 1 too often when coincident > 2.

    o	plot(1:3, exp(1:3), log = "y", ylim = c(30,1)) {reversed
	log-scale axis} now works, based on Uwe Ligges' suggestions.
	(PR#7894)

    o	install.packages() was aborting when a package in a bundle was
	chosen from a menu.  It failed if more than one package in a
	bundle was chosen from the command line.

    o	qcauchy() suffered from underflow in the extreme tails.	 (PR#7902)

    o	Printing of raw matrices/arrays was not implemented. (PR#7912)

    o	getCallingDLL()'s default first argument did not correspond to
	its description and has been changed.  The mismatch caused
	symbols in .C/.Call/.Fortran calls without a PACKAGE= argument
	to be potentially looked up in the wrong namespace.

    o	Binary save() of raw vectors was not working correctly on
	big-endian platforms.  (PR#7812)

    o	as.Date.factor() now accepts a format argument.

    o	Workaround added for FreeBSD which does not have alloca.h _and_
	does not allow alloca() to be declared.

    o	identify() now respects 'cex'.  (PR#660)

	Warnings from identify() are now printed immediately even on
	consoles with delayed printing.



		CHANGES IN R VERSION 2.1.0


USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o	box plots {by boxplot() or bxp()} now have the median line three
	times the normal line width in order to distinguish it from the
	quartile ones.

    o	Unix-alike versions of R can now be used in UTF-8 locales on
	suitably equipped OSes.	 See the internationalization section
	below.

    o	The meaning of 'encoding' for a connection has changed: See the
	internationalization section below.

    o	There has been some rationalization of the format of
	warning/error messages, to make them easier to translate.
	Generally names of functions and arguments are single-quoted,
	and classes double-quoted.

    o	Reading text files with embedded "\" (as in Windows file names)
	may now need to use scan(* , allowEscapes = FALSE), see also below.


NEW FEATURES

    o	%% now warns if its accuracy is likely to be affected by lack
	of precision (as in 1e18 %% 11, the unrealistic expectation of
	PR#7409), and tries harder to return a value in range when it is.

    o	abbreviate() now warns if used with non-ASCII chars, as the
	algorithm is designed for English words.

    o	The default methods for add1() and drop1() check for changes
	in the number of cases in use.

	The "lm" and "glm" methods for add1() quoted the <none> model
	on the original fitted values when using (with a warning) a
	smaller set of cases for the expanded models.

    o	Added alarm() function to generate a bell or beep or visual alert.

    o	all/any() now attempt to coerce their arguments to logical, as
	documented in the Blue Book.  This means e.g. any(list()) works.

    o	New functions for multivariate linear models: anova.mlm(),
	SSD(), estVar(), mauchley.test() (for sphericity).

	vcov() now does something more sensible for "mlm" class objects.

    o	as.data.frame.table() has a new argument 'responseName'
	(contributed by Bill Venables).

    o	as.dist() and cophenetic() are now generic, and the latter has a
	new method for objects of class "dendrogram".

    o	as.ts() is now generic.

    o	binomial() has a new "cauchit" link (suggested by Roger Koenker).

    o	chisq.test() has a new argument 'rescale.p'.  It is now possible
	to simulate (slowly) the P value also in the 1D case
	(contributed by Rolf Turner).

    o	choose(n,k) and lchoose(.) now also work for arbitrary (real) n
	in accordance with the general binomial theorem.  choose(*,k)
	is more accurate (and faster) for small k.

    o	Added colorRamp() and colorRampPalette() functions for color
	interpolation.

    o	colSums()/rowSums() now allow arrays with a zero-length extent
	(requested by PR#7775).

    o	confint() has stub methods for classes "glm" and "nls" that
	invoke those in package MASS.  This avoids using the "lm"
	method for "glm" objects if MASS is not attached.

	confint() has a default method using asymptotic normality.

    o	contr.SAS() has been moved from the 'nlme' package to the
	'stats' package.

    o	New function convertColors() maps between color spaces.
	colorRamp() uses it.

    o	The cov() function in the non-Pearson cases now ranks data after
	removal of missing values, not before.	The pairwise-complete
	method should now be consistent with cor.test.  (Code
	contributed by Shigenobu Aoki.)

    o	Added delayedAssign() function to replace delay(), which is now
	deprecated.

    o	dir.create() has a new argument 'recursive' serving the same
	purpose as Unix's mkdir -p.

    o	do.call() now takes either a function or a character string as
	its first argument.  The supplied arguments can optionally be
	quoted.

    o	duplicated() and unique() now accept "list" objects, but are
	fast only for simple list objects.

    o	ecdf() now has jumps of the correct size (a multiple of 1/n)
	if there are ties.  (Wished by PR#7292).

    o	eff.aovlist() assumed orthogonal contrasts for any term
	with more than one degree of freedom: this is now documented
	and checked for.  Where each term only occurs in only one
	stratum the efficiencies are all one: this is detected and
	orthogonal contrasts are not required.

    o	New function encodeString() to encode character strings in the
	same way that printing does.

    o	file("clipboard") now work for reading the primary selection on
	Unix-alikes with an active X11 display.	 (It has long worked
	for reading and writing under Windows.)	 The secondary
	selection can also be read: see ?file.

	file() now allows mode "w+b" as well as "w+".

    o	file.append() has been tuned, including for the case of
	appending many files to a single file.

    o	Functions flush.console() and select.list() are now available
	on all platforms.  There is a Tcl/Tk-based version of
	select.list() called tk_select.list() in package tcltk.

    o	gc() now reports maximum as well as current memory use.

    o	A new function getGraphicsEvent() has been added which will allow
	mouse or keyboard input from a graphics device. (NB: currently
	only the Windows screen device supports this function.	This
	should improve before the 2.1.0 release.)

    o	New functions gray.colors()/grey.colors() for gray color
	palettes.

    o	grep(), gsub(), sub() and regexpr() now always attempt to
	coerce their 'pattern', 'x', 'replacement' and 'text'
	arguments to character.	 Previously this was undocumented but
	done by [g]sub() and regexpr() for some values of their
	other arguments.  (Wish of PR#7742.)

    o	gsub/sub() have a new 'fixed' method.

    o	New function hcl() for creating colors for a given hue,
	chroma and luminance (i.e. perceptual hsv).

    o	isTRUE() convenience function to be used for programming.

    o	kmeans() now returns an object of class "kmeans" which has a
	print() method.

	Two alternative algorithms have been implemented.

	If the number of centres is supplied, it has a new option of
	multiple random starts.

    o	The limits on the grid size in layout() are now documented, and
	have been raised somewhat by using more efficient internal
	structures.

    o	legend() now accepts positioning by keyword, e.g. "topleft",
	and can put a title within the legend.  (Suggested by Elizabeth
	Purdom in PR#7400.)

    o	mahalanobis() now has a '...' argument which is passed to solve()
	for computing the inverse of the covariance matrix, this replaces
	the former 'tol.inv' argument.

    o	menu() uses a multi-column layout if possible for more than
	10 choices.

	menu(graphics = TRUE) is implemented on most platforms via
	select.list() or tk_select.list().

    o	New function message() in 'base' for generating "simple"
	diagnostic messages, replacing such a function in the
	'methods' package.

    o	na.contiguous() is now (S3) generic with first argument
	renamed to 'object'.

    o	New function normalizePath() to find canonical paths (and on
	Windows, canonical names of components).

    o	The default in options("expressions") has been increased to 5000,
	and the maximal settable value to 500000.

    o	p.adjust() has a new method "BY".

    o	pbeta() now uses a different algorithm for large values of at
	least one of the shape parameters, which is much faster and is
	accurate and reliable for very large values.  (This affects
	pbinom(), pf(), qbeta() and other functions using pbeta at C
	level.)

    o	pch="." now by default produces a rectangle at least 0.01" per
	side on high-resolution devices.  (It used to be one-pixel
	square even on high-resolution screens and Windows printers,
	but 1/72" on postscript() and pdf() devices.)  Additionally,
	the size is now scalable by 'cex'; see ?points and note that
	the details are subject to change.

    o	pdf() now responds to the 'paper' and 'pagecentre'
	arguments.  The default value of 'paper' is "special"
	for backward-compatibility (this is different from the
	default for postscript()).

    o	plot.data.frame() tries harder to produce sensible plots for
	non-numeric data frames with one or two columns.

    o	The predict() methods for "prcomp" and "princomp" now match
	the columns of 'newdata' to the original fit using column
	names if these are available.

    o	New function recordGraphics() to encapsulate calculations
	and graphics output together on graphics engine display list.
	To be used with care.

    o	New function RSiteSearch() to query R-related resources
	on-line (contributed by Jonathan Baron and Andy Liaw).

    o	scan() arranges to share storage of duplicated character
	strings read in: this can dramatically reduce the memory
	requirements for large character vectors which will
	subsequently be turned into factors with relatively few
	levels.	 For a million items this halved the time and reduced
	storage by a factor of 20.

	scan() has a new argument 'allowEscapes' (default TRUE) that
	controls when C-style escapes in the input are interpreted.
	Previously only \n and \r were interpreted, and then only
	within quoted strings when no separator was supplied.

	scan() used on an open connection now pushes back on the
	connection its private `ungetc' and so is safer to use to
	read partial lines.

    o	scatter.smooth() and loess.smooth() now handle missing values
	in their inputs.

    o	seq.Date() and seq.POSIXt() now allow 'to' to be before 'from'
	if 'by' is negative.

    o	sprintf() has been enhanced to allow the POSIX/XSI specifiers
	like "%2$6d", and also accepts "%x" and "%X".

	sprintf() does limited coercion of its arguments.

	sprintf() accepts vector arguments and operates on them in
	parallel (after re-cycling if needed).

    o	New function strtrim() to trim character vectors to a display
	width, allowing for double-width characters in multi-byte
	character sets.

    o	subset() now has a method for matrices, similar to that for
	data frames.

    o	Faster algorithm in summaryRprof().

    o	sunflowerplot() has new arguments 'col' and 'bg'.

    o	sys.function() now has argument 'which' (as has long been
	presaged on its help page).

    o	Sys.setlocale("LC_ALL", ) now only sets the locale categories
	which R uses, and Sys.setlocale("LC_NUMERIC", ) now gives a
	warning (as it can cause R to malfunction).

    o	unclass() is no longer allowed for environments and external
	pointers (since these cannot be copied and so unclass() was
	destructive of its argument).  You can still change the
	"class" attribute.

    o	File-name matching is no longer case-insensitive with unz()
	connections, even on Windows.

    o	New argument 'immediate.' to warning() to send an immediate
	warning.

    o	New convenience wrappers write.csv() and write.csv2().

    o	There is a new version for write.table() which is implemented in C.
	For simple matrices and data frames this is several times
	faster than before, and uses negligible memory compared to the
	object size.

	The old version (which no longer coerces a matrix to a data
	frame and then back to a matrix) is available for now as
	write.table0().

    o	The functions xinch(), yinch(), and xyinch() have been moved
	from package 'grDevices' into package 'graphics'.


    o	Plotmath now allows underline in expressions.  (PR#7286,
	contributed by Uwe Ligges.)

    o	BATCH on Unix no longer sets --gui="none" as the X11 module
	is only loaded if needed.

    o	The X11 module (and the hence X11(), jpeg() and png() devices
	and the X-based dataentry editor) is now in principle
	available under all Unix GUIs except --gui="none", and this is
	reflected in capabilities().

	capabilities("X11") determines if an X server can be accessed,
	and so is more likely to be accurate.

    o	Printing of arrays now honours the 'right' argument if there
	are more than two dimensions.

    o	Tabular printing of numbers now has headers right-justified, as
	they were prior to version 1.7.0 (spotted by Rob Baer).

    o	Lazy-loading databases are now cached in memory at first use:
	this enables R to run much faster from slow file systems such
	as USB flash drives.  There is a small (less than 2Mb)
	increase in default memory usage.

    o	The implicit class structure for numeric vectors has been
	changed, so that integer/real vectors try first methods for
	class "integer"/"double" and then those for class "numeric".

	The implicit classes for matrices and arrays have been changed
	to be "matrix"/"array" followed by the class(es) of the
	underlying vector.

    o	splines::splineDesign() now allows the evaluation of a B-spline
	basis everywhere instead of just inside the "inner" knots, by
	setting the new argument `outer.ok = TRUE'.

    o	Hashing has been tweaked to use half as much memory as before.

    o	Readline is not used for tilde expansion when R is run with
	--no-readline, nor from embedded applications.	Then "~name"
	is no longer expanded, but "~" still is.

    o	The regular expression code is now based on that in glibc 2.3.3.
	It has stricter conformance to POSIX, so metachars such as
	{ } + * may need to be escaped where before they did not
	(but could have been).

    o	New encoding 'TeXtext.enc' improves the way postscript() works
	with Computer Modern fonts.

    o	Replacement in a non-existent column of a data frame tries
	harder to create a column of the correct length and so avoid a
	corrupt data frame.

    o	For Windows and readline-based history, the saved file size is
	re-read from R_HISTSIZE immediately before saving.

    o	Collected warnings during start-up are now printed before the
	initial prompt rather than after the first command.

    o	Changes to package 'grid':

	- preDrawDetails(), drawDetails(), and postDrawDetails()
	  methods are now recorded on the graphics engine
	  display list.	  This means that calculations within these
	  methods are now run when a device is resized or
	  when output is copied from one device to another.

	- Fixed bug in grid.text() when 'rot' argument has length 0.
	  (privately reported by Emmanuel Paradis)

	- New getNames() function to return just the names of all top-level
	  grobs on the display list.

	- Recording on the grid display list is turned off within
	  preDrawDetails(), drawDetails(), and postDrawDetails() methods.

	- Grid should recover better from errors or user-interrupts
	  during drawing (i.e., not leave you in a strange viewport
	  or with strange graphical parameter settings).

	- New function grid.refresh() to redraw the grid display list.

	- New function grid.record() to capture calculations
	  with grid graphics output.

	- grobWidth and grobHeight ("grobwidth" and "grobheight" units)
	  for primitives (text, rects, etc, ...) are now
	  calculated based on a bounding box for the relevant grob.

	  NOTE: this has changed the calculation of the size of a scalar
	  rect (or circle or lines).

	- New arguments 'warn' and 'wrap' for function grid.grab()

	- New function grid.grabExpr() which captures the output from
	  an expression (i.e., not from the current scene) without
	  doing any drawing (i.e., no impact on the current scene).

	- upViewport() now (invisibly) returns the path that it goes up
	  (suggested by Ross Ihaka).

	- The 'gamma' gpar has been deprecated (this is a device property
	  not a property of graphical objects;	suggested by Ross Ihaka).

	- New 'lex' gpar;  a line width multiplier.

	- grid.text() now handles any language object as mathematical
	  annotation (instead of just expressions).

	- plotViewport() has default value for 'margins' argument (that match
	  the default value for par(mar)).

	- The 'extension' argument to dataViewport() can now be vector,
	  in which case the first value is used to extend the xscale and
	  the second value is used to extend the y scale.
	  (suggested by Ross Ihaka).

	- All 'just' arguments (for viewports, layouts, rectangles, text)
	  can now be numeric values (typically between 0 [left] and 1 [right])
	  as well as character values ("left", "right", ...).

	  For rectangles and text, there are additional 'hjust' and 'vjust'
	  arguments which allow numeric vectors of justification in
	  each direction (e.g., so that several pieces of text can have
	  different justifications).
	  (suggested by Ross Ihaka)

	- New 'edits' argument for grid.xaxis() and grid.yaxis() to
	  allow specification of on-the-fly edits to axis children.

	- applyEdit(x, edit) returns x if target of edit (i.e., child
	  specified by a gPath) cannot be found.

	- Fix for calculation of length of max/min/sum unit.  Length is
	  now (correctly) reported as 1 (was reported as length of first arg).

	- Viewport names can now be any string (they used to have to be a
	  valid R symbol).

	- The 'label' argument for grid.xaxis() and grid.yaxis() can now
	  also be a language object or string vector, in which case it
	  specifies custom labels for the tick marks.


INTERNATIONALIZATION

    o	Unix-alike versions of R can now be used in UTF-8 and other
	multi-byte locales on suitably equipped OSes if configured
	with option --enable-mbcs (which is the default).  [The
	changes to font handling in the X11 module are based on the
	Japanization patches of Ei-ji Nakama.]

	Windows versions of R can be used in `East Asian' locales on
	suitable versions of Windows.

	See the 'Internationalization' chapter in the 'Installation
	and Administration' manual.

    o	New command-line flag --encoding to specify the encoding to
	be assumed for stdin (but not for a console).

    o	New function iconv() to convert character vectors between
	encodings, on those OSes which support this.  See the new
	capabilities("iconv").

    o	The meaning of 'encoding' for a connection has changed: it now
	allows any charset encoding supported by iconv on the
	platform, and can re-encode output as well as input.

	As the new specification is a character string and the old was
	numeric, this should not cause incorrect operation.

    o	New function localeToCharset() to find/guess encoding(s) from
	the locale name.

    o	nchar() returns the true number of bytes stored (including any
	embedded nuls), this being 2 for missing values.  It has an
	optional argument 'type' with possible non-default values
	"chars" and "width" to give the number of characters or the
	display width in columns.

    o	Characters can be entered in hexadecimal as e.g. \x9c, and in
	UTF-8 and other multibyte locales as \uxxxx, \u{xxxx},
	\Uxxxxxxxx or \U{xxxxxxxx}.  Non-printable Unicode characters
	are displayed C-style as \uxxxx or \Uxxxxxxxx.

    o	LC_MONETARY is set to the locale, which affects the result of
	Sys.localeconv(), but nothing else in R itself.	 (It could
	affect add-on packages.)

    o	source() now has an 'encoding' argument which can be used to
	make it try out various possible encodings.  This is made use
	of by example() which will convert (non-UTF-8) Latin-1 example
	files in a UTF-8 locale.

    o	read/writeChar() work in units of characters, not bytes.

    o	.C() now accepts an ENCODING= argument where re-encoding is
	supported by the OS.  See `Writing R Extensions'.

    o	delimMatch (tools) now reports match positions and lengths in
	units of characters, not bytes.	 The delimiters can be
	strings, not just single ASCII characters.

    o	.Rd files can indicate via a \encoding{} argument the encoding
	that should be assumed for non-ASCII characters they contain.

    o	Phrases in .Rd files can be marked by \enc{}{} to show a
	transliteration to ASCII for use in e.g. text help.

    o	The use of 'pch' in points() now allows for multi-byte character
	sets: in such a locale a glyph can either be specified as a
	multi-byte single character or as a number, the Unicode point.

    o	New function l10n_info() reports on aspects of the
	locale/charset currently in use.

    o	scan() is now aware of double-byte locales such as Shift-JIS
	in which ASCII characters can occur as the second ('trail')
	byte.

    o	Functions sQuote() and dQuote() use the Unicode directional
	quotes if in a UTF-8 locale.

    o	The infrastructure is now in place for C-level error and warning
	messages to be translated and used on systems with Native
	Language Support.  This has been used for the startup message
	in English and to translate Americanisms such as 'color' into
	English: translations to several other languages are under
	way, and some are included in this release.

	See 'Writing R Extensions' for how to make use of this in a
	package: all the standard packages have been set up to do
	translation, and the 'language' 'en@quot' is implemented to
	allow Unicode directional quotes in a UTF-8 locale.

    o	R-level stop(), warning() and message() messages can be
	translated, as can other messages via the new function
	gettext(). Tools xgettext() and xgettext2pot() are provided in
	package tools to help manage error messages.

	gettextf() is a new wrapper to call sprintf() using
	gettext() on the format string.

    o	Function ngettext() allows the management of singular and
	plural forms of messages.


UTILITIES

    o	New functions mirror2html() and checkCRAN().

    o	R CMD check has a new option '--use-valgrind'.

    o	R CMD check now checks that Fortran and C++ files have LF
	line endings, as well as C files.  It also checks Makevars[.in]
	files for portable compilation flags.

    o	R CMD check will now work on a source tarball and prints out
	information about the version of R and the package.

    o	tools:::.install_package_code_files() (used to collate R files
	when installing packages) ensures files are separated by a
	line feed.

    o	vignette() now returns an object of class "vignette" whose
	print() method opens the corresponding PDF file.  The edit()
	method can be used to open the code of the vignette in an
	editor.

    o	R CMD INSTALL on Unix has a new option '--build' matching
	that on Windows, to package as tarball the installed package.

    o	R CMD INSTALL on Unix can now install binary bundles.

    o	R CMD build now changes src files to LF line endings if necessary.

    o	R CMD build now behaves consistently between source and binary
	builds: in each case it prepares a source directory and then
	either packages that directory as a tarball or calls R CMD
	INSTALL --build on the prepared sources.

	This means that R CMD build --binary now respects
	.Rbuildignore and will rebuild vignettes (unless the option
	--no-vignettes is used).  For the latter, it now installs the
	current sources into a temporary library and uses that version
	of the package/bundle to rebuild the vignettes.

    o	R CMD build now reports empty directories in the source tree.

    o	New function write_PACKAGES() in package 'tools' to help with
	preparing local package repositories.  (Based on a contribution
	by Uwe Ligges.)	 How to prepare such repositories is
	documented in the 'R Installation and Administration' manual.

    o	package.skeleton() adds a bit more to DESCRIPTION.

    o	Sweave changes:

	- \usepackage[nogin]{Sweave} in the header of an Sweave file
	  supresses auto-setting of the graphical parameter like width
	  of graphics.

	- The new \SweaveInput{} command works similar to LaTeX's
	  \input{} command.

	- Option value strip.white=all strips all blank lines from the
	  output of a code chunk.

	- Code chunks with eval=false are commented out by Stangle() and
	  hence no longer tested by R CMD check.


DOCUMENTATION

    o	File doc/html/faq.html no longer exists, and doc/manual/R-FAQ.html
	(which has active links to other manuals) is used instead.
	(If makeinfo >= 4.7 is not available, the version on CRAN is
	linked to.)

    o	Manual 'Writing R Extensions' has further details on writing
	new front-ends for R using the new public header files.

    o	There are no longer any restrictions on characters in the
	\name{} field of a .Rd file: in particular _ is supported.


C-LEVEL FACILITIES

    o	There are new public C/C++ header files Rinterface.h and
	R_ext/RStartup.h for use with external GUIs.

    o	Added an onExit() function to graphics devices, to be executed
	upon user break if non-NULL.

    o	ISNAN now works even in C++ code that undefines the 'isnan' macro.

    o	R_alloc's limit on 64-bit systems has been raised from just
	under 2^31 bytes (2Gb) to just under 2^34 (16Gb), and is now checked.

    o	New math utility functions  log1pmx(x), lgamma1p(x),
	logspace_add(logx, logy), and logspace_sub(logx, logy).


DEPRECATED & DEFUNCT

    o	The aqua module for MacOS X has been removed: --with-aqua now
	refers to the unbundled Cocoa GUI.

    o	Capabilities "bzip2", "GNOME, "libz" and "PCRE" are defunct.

    o	The undocumented use of UseMethod() with no argument was
	deprecated in 2.0.1 and is now regarded as an error.

    o	Capability "IEEE754" is deprecated.

    o	The 'CRAN' argument to update.packages(), old.packages(),
	new.packages(), download.packages() and install.packages() is
	deprecated in favour of 'repos', which replaces it as a
	positional argument (so this is only relevant for calls with
	named args).

    o	The S3 methods for getting and setting names of "dist" objects
	have been removed (as they provided names with a different
	length from the "dist" object itself).

    o	Option "repositories" is no longer used and so not set.

    o	loadURL() is deprecated in favour of load(url()).

    o	delay() is deprecated.	Use delayedAssign() instead.


INSTALLATION CHANGES

    o	New configure option --enable-mbcs to enable support for
	UTF-8 locales, on by default.

    o	R_XTRA_[CF]FLAGS are now used during the configuration tests,
	and [CF]PICFLAGS if --enable-R-shlib was specified.  This
	ensures that features such as inlining are only used if the
	compilation flags specified support them.  (PR#7257)

    o	Files FAQ, RESOURCES, doc/html/resources.html are no longer in
	the SVN sources but are made by 'make dist'.

    o	The GNOME GUI is unbundled, now provided as a package on CRAN.

    o	Configuring without having the recommended packages is now an
	error unless --with-recommended-packages=no (or equivalent) is used.

    o	Configuring without having the X11 headers and libraries is now
	an error unless --with-x=no (or equivalent) is used.

    o	Configure tries harder to find a minimal set of FLIBS.	Under
	some circumstances this may remove from R_LD_LIBRARY_PATH
	path elements that ought to have specified in LDFLAGS (but
	were not).

    o	The C code for most of the graphics device drivers and their
	afm files are now in package grDevices.

    o	R is now linked against ncurses/termlib/termcap only if
	readline is specified (now the default) and that requires it.

    o	Makeinfo 4.7 or later is now required for building the HTML and
	Info versions of the manuals.


PACKAGE INSTALLATION CHANGES

    o	There are new types of packages, identified by the Type field
	in the DESCRIPTION file.  For example the GNOME console is now
	a separate package (on CRAN), and translations can be
	distributed as packages.

    o	There is now support of installing from within R both source and
	binary packages on MacOS X and Windows.	 Most of the R
	functions now have a 'type' argument defaulting to
	getOption("pkgType") and with possible values "source",
	"win.binary" and "mac.binary".	The default is "source" except
	under Windows and the CRAN GUI build for MacOS X.

    o	install.packages() and friends now accept a vector of URLs for
	'repos' or 'contriburl' and get the newest available version of
	a package from the first repository on the list in which it is
	found.	The argument 'CRAN' is still accepted, but deprecated.

	install.packages() on Unix can now install from local .tar.gz
	files via repos = NULL (as has long been done on Windows).

	install.packages() no longer asks if downloaded packages
	should be deleted: they will be deleted at the end of the
	session anyway (and can be deleted by the user at any time).

	If the repository provides the information, install.packages()
	will now accept the name of a package in a bundle.

	If 'pkgs' is omitted install.packages() will use a listbox to
	display the available packages, on suitable systems.

	'dependencies' can be a character vector to allow only some
	levels of dependencies (e.g. not "Suggests") to be requested.

    o	There is a new possible value update.packages(ask="graphics")
	that uses a widget to (de)select packages, on suitable systems.

    o	The option used is now getOption("repos") not getOption("CRAN")
	and it is initially set to a dummy value.  Its value can be a
	character vector (preferably named) giving one or several
	repositories.

	A new function chooseCRANmirror() will select a CRAN mirror.
	This is called automatically if the contrib.url() encounters
	the initial dummy value of getOption("repos")

	A new function setRepositories() can be used to create
	getOption("repos") from a (platform-specific) list of known
	repositories.

    o	New function new.packages() to report uninstalled packages
	available at the requested repositories.  This also reports
	incomplete bundles.  It will optionally install new packages.

    o	New function available.packages(), similar to CRAN.packages()
	but for use with multiple repositories.	 Both now only report
	packages whose R version requirements are met.

    o	update.packages() and old.packages() have a new option
	'checkBuilt' to allow packages installed under earlier
	versions of R to be updated.

    o	remove.packages() can now remove bundles.

    o	The Contains: field of the DESCRIPTION file of package bundles
	is now installed, so later checks can find out if the bundle
	is complete.

    o	packageStatus() is now built on top of *.packages, and gains a
	'method' argument.  It defaults to the same repositories as
	the other tools, those specified by getOption("repos").


BUG FIXES

    o	Configuring for Tcl/Tk makes use of ${TK_LIB_SPEC} ${TK_LIBS}
	not ${TK_LIB_SPEC} ${TK_XLIBSW}, which is correct for
	recent versions of Tk, but conceivably not for old
	tkConfig.sh files.

    o	detach() was not recomputing the S4 methods for primitives
	correctly.

    o	Methods package now has class "expression" partly fixed in basic
	classes, so S4 classes can extend these (but "expression" is
	pretty broken as a vector class in R).

    o	Collected warnings had messages with unneeded trailing space.

    o	S4 methods for primitive functions must be exported from
	namespaces; this is now done automatically.
	Note that is.primitive() is now in "base", not "methods".

    o	Package grid:

	- Fixed bug in grid.text() when "rot" argument has length 0.
	  (reported by Emmanuel Paradis)

    o	.install_package_vignette_index() created an index even in an
	empty 'doc' directory.

    o	The print() method for factors now escapes characters in the
	levels in the same way as they are printed.

    o	str() removed any class from environment objects.

	str() no longer interprets control characters in character
	strings and factor levels; also no longer truncates factor
	levels unless they are longer than 'nchar.max'.
	Truncation of such long strings is now indicated ''outside''
	the string.

	str(<S4.object>) was misleading for the case of a single slot.

	str() now also properly displays S4 class definitions (such as
	returned by getClass().

    o	print.factor(quote=TRUE) was not quoting levels, causing
	ambiguity when the levels contained spaces or quotes.

    o	R CMD check was confused by a trailing / on a package name.

    o	write.table() was writing incorrect column names if the data
	frame contained any matrix-like columns.

    o	write.table() was not quoting row names for a 0-column x.

    o	t(x)'s default method now also preserves names(dimnames(x)) for
	1D arrays 'x'.

    o	r <- a %*% b no longer produces names(dimnames(r)) == c("", "")
	unless one of a or b has named dimnames.

    o	Some .Internal functions that were supposed to return invisibly
	did not. This was behind PR#7397 and PR#7466.

    o	eval(expr, NULL, encl) now looks up variables in encl, as
	eval(expr, list(), encl) always did

    o	Coercing as.data.frame(NULL) to a pairlist caused an error.

    o	p.adjust(p, ..) now correctly works when `p' contains NAs (or when
	it is of length 0 or length 2 for method = "hommel").

    o	'methods' initialization was calling a function intended for
	.Call() with .C().

    o	optim() needed a check that the objective function returns a
	value of length 1 (spotted by Ben Bolker).

    o	X11() was only scaling its fonts to pointsize if the dpi
	was within 0.5 of 100dpi.

    o	X11() font selection was looking for any symbol font, and
	sometimes got e.g. bold italic if the server has such a font.

    o	dpois(*, lambda=Inf) now returns 0 (or -Inf for log).

    o	Using pch="" gave a square (pch=0)!  Now it is regarded as the
	same as NA, which was also undocumented but omits the point.

    o	Base graphics now notices (ab)lines which have a zero
	coordinate on log scale, and omits them.  (PR#7559)

    o	stop() and warning() now accept NULL as they are documented
	to do (although this seems of little use and is equivalent to "").

    o	weighted.mean() now checks the length of the weight vector w.

    o	getAnywhere() was confused by names with leading or trailing dots
	(spotted by Robert McGehee)

    o	eval() was not handling values from return() correctly.

    o	par(omd) is now of the form c(x1, x2, y1, y2) to match the
	documentation and for S-PLUS compatibility.

	[Previously, par(omd) was of the form c(bottom, left, top, right)
	 like par(oma) and par(omi)]

    o	formatC() did not check its 'flag' argument, and could
	segfault if it was incorrect. (PR#7686)

    o	Contrasts needed to be coerced to numeric (e.g. from integer)
	inside model.matrix.  (PR#7695)

    o	socketSelect() did not check for buffered input.

    o	Reads on a non-blocking socket with no available data were
	not handled properly and could result in a segfault.

    o	The "aovlist" method for se.contrast() failed in some very
	simple cases that were effectively not multistratum designs,
	e.g. only one treatment occurring in only one stratum.

    o	pgamma() uses completely re-written algorithms, and should work
	for all (even very extreme) arguments; this is based on Morten
	Welinder's contribution related to PR#7307.

    o	dpois(10, 2e-308, log=TRUE) and similar cases gave -Inf.

    o	x <- 2^(0:1000);    plot(x, x^.9, type="l", log="xy")# and
	x <- 2^-(1070:170); plot(x, x^.9, type="l", log="xy")# now both work

    o	summary.lm() asked for a report on a reasonable occurrence, but
	the check failed to take account of NAs.

    o	lm() was miscalculating 'df.residual' for empty models with a
	matrix response.

    o	summary.lm() now behaves more sensibly for empty models.

    o	plot.window() was using the wrong sign when adjusting
	xlim/ylim for positive 'asp' and a reversed axis.

    o	If malloc() fails when allocating a large object the allocator now
	does a gc and tries the malloc() again.

    o	packageSlot() and getGroupMembers() are now exported from the
	'methods' package as they should from documentation and the
	Green Book.

    o	rhyper() was giving numbers slightly too small, due to a bug in the
	original algorithm.  (PR#7314)

    o	gsub() was sometimes incorrectly matching ^ inside a string,
	e.g.  gsub("^12", "x", "1212") was "xx".

    o	[g]sub(perl = TRUE) was giving random results for a 0-length
	initial match.  (PR#7742)

    o	[g]sub was ignoring most 0-length matches, including all initial
	ones.  Note that substitutions such as gsub("[[:space:]]*", "
	", ...) now work as they do in 'sed' (whereas the effect was
	previously the same as gsub("[[:space:]]+", " ", ...)).
	(In part PR#7742)

    o	Promises are now evaluated when extracted from an environment
	using '$' or '[[ ]]'.

    o	reshape(direction="wide") had some sorting problems when
	guessing time points (PR#7669)

    o	par() set 'xaxp' before 'xlog' and 'yaxp' before 'ylog',
	causing PR#831.

    o	The logic in tclRequire() to check the availability of a Tcl
	package turned out to be fallible.  It now uses a try()-and-see
	mechanism instead.

    o	Opening a unz() connection on a non-existent file left a file
	handle in use.

    o	"dist" objects of length 0 failed to print.

    o	INSTALL and the libR try harder to find a temporary directory
	(since there might be one left over with the same PID).

    o	acf() could cause a segfault with some datasets.  (PR#7771)

    o	tan(1+LARGEi) now gives 0+1i rather than 0+NaNi (PR#7781)

    o	summary(data.frame(mat = I(matrix(1:8, 4)))) does not go into
	infinite recursion anymore.

    o	writeBin() performed byte-swapping incorrectly on complex
	vectors, also swapping real and imaginary parts. (PR#7778)

    o	read.table() sometimes discarded as blank lines containing
	only white space, even if sep=",".

	**************************************************


		CHANGES IN R VERSION 2.0.1 patched



NEW FEATURES

    o	warnings() now looks only in the workspace for `last.warning'
	(suggested by PR#7363).

    o	The search for browsers now starts with firefox, and has mozilla
	ahead of netscape.


PACKAGE INSTALLATION CHANGES

    o	A package DESCRIPTION file which contains a Built field (it
	should not!) is now worked around, with loud warnings.


BUG FIXES

    o	split() was accepting raw and list vectors as input, but
	not populating the output correctly.

	split() now handles vectors with names internally and so is
	almost as fast as on vectors without names (and maybe 100x
	faster than before).

    o	subset() now throws an error if its 'subset' argument is not
	logical whereas it could appear to work and give wrong answers
	with e.g. a numeric 'subset' argument.

    o	sum(), max(), min(), prod(), any() and all() were incorrectly
	using partial matching for their na.rm argument.

    o	kmeans() now ensures that the initial cluster centers it chooses
	are distinct.

    o	text()'s default method could segfault if passed 0-length coordinates.

    o	R CMD INSTALL (Unix) was sometimes leaving a temporary dir
	behind.	 (PR#7230)

    o	read.table() could fail when the row.names were looking like numbers.

    o	seq(length= <n>) now always returns "integer" storage.

    o	labels.lm was broken. (PR#7417)

    o	The hashing used for character vectors in object.size() was
	inefficient for vectors with thousands of identical values not
	sharing the same storage (an unusual case).

    o	data.matrix() now warns if applied to a data frame with
	classed columns.

    o	Plotting histograms where the expression used to deparse to
	multiple lines now gives a sensible default title.  (PR#7421)

    o	The print method for getDLLRegisteredRoutines() was badly
	designed, and failed for all the standard packages' DLLs.

    o	getDLLRegisteredRoutines.character() was broken.

    o	write.table(x, row.names=FALSE) was incorrect for a 0-column x.

    o	write.table() assumed dec = "," if it was not ".".

    o	morley.tab used by R-intro was not installed on Unix since 2.0.0
	(it was on Windows).

    o	gsub(perl=TRUE) returned a string which printed with trailing
	garbage if there was a match at the beginning whose
	replacement was shorter.  (PR#7479)

	Similarly, the result was truncated if a replacement at the
	beginning was longer.

    o	Some PDF readers do not define PDFDocEncoding, so pdf()'s
	ISOLatin1 encoding is now derived from WinAnsi rather than
	PDFDocEncoding.

    o	xfig() had not been updated for the 2.0.0 alpha changes.
	Using more than one plot with a non-white background and with
	onefile=FALSE could segfault.

    o	sprintf() did not check for buffer overflow on character
	strings.  (PR#7554)

    o	The error message when evaluation depth was exceeded itself
	caused an error in deparsing and so was not shown.

    o	The 'datalist' file was not being used during installation
	(2.0.1 only).

    o	replications() was wrongly reporting lack of balance in
	designs with interactions (and had since unique() gained a
	matrix method).



		CHANGES IN R VERSION 2.0.1


NEW FEATURES

    o	Platform equivalence in library() is tested by a new function
	testPlatformEquivalence() which ignores the 'vendor' field and
	can be customized by cognescenti.

    o	The assignment form of split() allows recycling of vectors
	within the value list. In particular, things like
	    split(x, g) <- lapply(split(x, g), mean)
	now work


DOCUMENTATION

    o	Manual `Writing R Extensions' has new sections on writing
	portable packages and on writing new front-ends for R -- the
	latter will be more comprehensive in R 2.1.0 which has new
	public header files.


DEPRECATED & DEFUNCT

    o	The aqua module in MacOS X is deprecated.

    o	Capabilities "bzip2", "GNOME, "libz" and "PCRE" are deprecated.

    o	The GNOME GUI on Unix-alikes is deprecated as part of R;
	it will be available in another form as from R 2.1.0.

    o	The undocumented use of UseMethod() with no argument is now
	formally deprecated.


INSTALLATION CHANGES

    o	Building on Alpha OSF/1 no longer forces the C flag -std1,
	which appears to be no longer needed.  (PR#7257)

    o	The compiler flag -mieee-fp is no longer used on i386 Linux
	(these days it is only passed to the linker and was only
	invoked for compilation steps).

    o	-D__NO_MATH_INLINES is only used on older ix86 glibc-based
	systems which need it (tested at configure time).  This leads to
	small improvements in speed and accuracy on modern systems.

    o	If makeinfo >= 4.5 is not available, warnings are given that
	some of the HTML manuals will be missing, and the index page
	given by help.start() will link to CRAN versions of those manuals.

    o	Files aclocal.m4 and acinclude.m4 used in maintainer builds
	are not longer included in the distribution.


C-LEVEL FACILITIES

    o	It was not clear in 'Writing R Extensions' that some of the
	entry points in the 'Utilities' section were not declared in
	<R.h> (they were in <R_ext/Applic.h>).	Now all the entry
	points in that section are declared in <R_ext/Utils.h>,
	included by <R.h>.


BUG FIXES

    o	The grid.grab() function in package grid would throw an error
	if there were no viewports pushed (now returns NULL).

    o	model.frame.default() takes row names from the response
	variable if that has suitable names and there is no 'data'
	argument.  (This follows S but was not previously implemented
	in R.)

    o	write.table() was not respecting the 'dec' argument for complex
	numbers.

    o	write.table() printed a mixture of numeric and complex numbers
	as all complex.	 (PR#7260)

    o	R CMD INSTALL failed with versioned installs on packages which
	save images (only).

    o	dlogis() gave NaN not 0 for large negative arguments.

    o	Importing from another namespace was broken for versioned
	installs, incorrectly reporting something like
	"package 'imported_from' does not have a name space".

    o	The GNOME interface under Linux/Unix was broken. (PR#7276)

    o	For the jpeg/png devices under Linux/Unix, under certain rare
	circumstances clipping needed to be cleared before starting a
	new page.  (PR#7270, which has been the case since the devices
	were introduced in 1.1.0.)

    o	First lattice plot (first grid.newpage() call) did not start
	a new page IF there had been a previous traditional graphics
	plot (on the same device).

    o	Using install.packages() to install the same package to more
	than one library gave an incorrect warning message.  (If there
	were two or more such packages it might give an error.)

    o	.packages(all.available=TRUE) returned packages with an invalid
	version field in their DESCRIPTION whereas .find.packages() and
	packageDescription() did not.  Now all do not.

    o	packageDescription() now correctly reports that a package does
	not exist, rather than that its DESCRIPTION file is 'missing
	or broken'.

    o	'make dist' from builddir != sourcedir was copying not linking
	recommended packages to *.tgz.

    o	Slots in prototype objects can inherit from locally defined
	classes (which were not being found correctly before).

    o	Several fixes to the behavior of as() when there are either
	coerce= or replace= methods supplied in a call to
	setIs(). Related fixes to setIs() to handle correctly previous
	methods, if there were any.

    o	splinefun(1[0], 1[0])(1) doesn't segfault anymore (PR#7290).
	spline() and splinefun() now also work with missing values by
	omiting them.

    o	ecdf() was failing on inputs containing NAs. (Part of PR#7292)

    o	tools:::.install_package_description was splitting the Built:
	field across lines on platforms with very long names.

    o	capabilities() was wrong for the Aqua GUI on MacOS X.

    o	Using Rprof() with a non-writable 'file' argument is now a
	non-fatal error and does not abort R.

    o	binom.test() did not deparse its arguments early enough such
	that the reported data were ugly if x was a table.

    o	Systems based on glibc, including those using R's substitute for
	strptime, were handling strptime("2001", "%Y") incorrectly, in
	some cases crashing.  R's substitute code has been corrected
	(but problems may remain if glibc is used).  See the ?strptime
	for what should happen (which is system-specific).

    o	untrace() after trace() failed if package 'methods' was attached.
	(PR#7301)

    o	summary.stepfun() was reporting for n > 6 summaries of the
	knots and levels as the actual values.	Both print() and
	summary() methods called the constant values "step heights",
	although they were not the heights of the steps.

    o	is.na/is.nan() were giving spurious warnings if applied to a
	raw vector.

    o	is.atomic() gave incorrect result (false) for a raw vector.

    o	rank() and order() accepted raw and list inputs, but did not
	give a sensible answer (always 1:n).  Similarly, partial sorts
	of a raw vector were accepted but did nothing.

    o	require() without a version argument tried for an unversioned
	load of a package even though a versioned install was already
	loaded.	 This often led to a message that a required package
	was being loaded when it was not actually being loaded.

    o	str(<S4.object>) made use of attributes() instead of slot(),
	and hence didn't properly print NULL slots.

    o	contrib.url() now handles URLs ending in '/' correctly.

    o	str() removed any class from externalptr objects.

    o	logLik() and hence AIC() failed or gave incorrect answers
	on "lm" fits with na.action = na.exclude (and perhaps other
	na.actions's except na.omit and na.fail).

    o	pmax() and pmin() sometimes used NAs in internal subassignments,
	and sometimes these failed.

    o	Subassigning an expression, e.g. expr[2] <- 1, could leave an
	invalid object and so cause a segfault. (PR#7326)

    o	download/install.packages() would misbehave if there was more
	than one version of a package in a repository.

    o	sort(partial=) silently ignored some other arguments: using
	'decreasing' or 'index.return' or supplying a factor are now
	errors.

    o	The ave() function had trouble if the grouping contained
	unused levels.

    o	read.fwf() got confused by skip > 0 and could infinite loop
	under some circumstances.  (PR#7350)

    o	upgrade(x, ask = FALSE) was broken for a "packageStatus" object.

    o	Class "raw" had been omitted from the list of basic classes in
	the "methods" package and so could not be used in S4 classes.

    o	Function getGroupMembers(), part of the definition of S4
	classes, had been promised for release 2.0, but slipped through.

    o	toLatex(sessionInfo()) produced incorrect LaTeX on some
	platforms due to special characters in the platform
	identifier.
