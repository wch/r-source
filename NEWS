NEW FEATURES

    o	A first step in improving performance has been made.
	Attached objects, libraries etc are now hashed; performance
	gains will be particularly apparent if large packages are in use.

    o	First version of package ts for time-series analysis.
	This has fairly complete S-PLUS compatibility, but more features
	are planned. See library(help=ts) for details.

    o	warnings can be collected (options(warn=0), the default), printed
	immediately (options(warn=1)) or turned into errors (options(warn=2)).
	As a consequence, all warnings and errors now are printed followed
	by a newline, if one is not supplied. (This should improve the
	S compatibility of the use of PROBLEM ... in compiled code.)



    o	All R environment variables are now of the form `R_xxx'.  In
	particular, `RHOME', `RLIBS' and `RPROFILE' are now called
	`R_HOME', `R_LIBS', and `R_PROFILE'.

    o	The handling of q()/quit()/EOF has been changed, with a new option
	"default".  In interactive use this asks unless --save or --no-save
	has been specified: if these are specified they set the default.

    o	Limited capability for tilde expansion of file names even without
	readline (on Unix, and on Windows).

    o	New environment variables `R_HISTFILE' and `R_HISTSIZE' for the
	name and size of the history file.

    o	Attempting to restore (at startup) too large a .RData is now
	a fatal error.

    o	The loading of shared library on Unix now uses RTLD_NOW not
	RTLD_LAZY.  This means that all symbols must be resolvable
	when the library is loaded, and R will not terminate later
	when a missing symbol is called.  Code which had missing symbols
	(including some packages) will need to be re-compiled.



    o	New generic function all.equal();
	most useful for numerical comparisons `up to rounding errors'.

    o	New function boxplot.formula() as a formula interface to boxplots.

    o	New functions getwd() and setwd() for getting and setting the R
	working directory, basename() and dirname() for manipulating paths.

    o	Function locator(, type=) is implemented to plot points or
	draw lines interactively.

    o	Functions new.env() to create empty environment and local() to
	allow local evaluation of expressions, with various useful
	idiomatic uses.

    o	Convenience functions parent.frame() and eval.parent().



    o	A new scheme for keeping source code with user-defined
	functions has been implemented. In particular, comments
	will no longer move about or disappear. The flip side of the
	coin is that you can no longer rely on R to indent your
	code for you. The stored-source facility can be turned
	off with options(keep.source=FALSE), and for an individual
	function by deleting the "source" attribute.

	If the source attribute is absent, the function will be
	deparsed for editing or printing, but any comments will be
	lost.

    o	expressions have gained semantics that are closer to
	those of S. They don't get evaluated except when explicitly
	specified. Example:

	e <- expression(x); e[[1]] <- expression(123); eval(e)

	now gives expression(123), not 123. This fixes some problems
	with expressions in the list argument to do.call().



    o	contrast() no longer drops colnames for 1DF contrasts.
	Consequentially, the labels of regression coefficients for binary
	factors contain level names (again ...).

    o	na.omit() and na.fail() are now generic.

    o	plot.lm() has more options and now does 4 plots by default, should
	also be okay for "glm" object; all thanks to John Maindonald.

    o	If the dimnames of a table are themselves named, then their names
	are used to label the respective dimensions in tabular output.

    o	chisq.test() now optionally computes the p-value by Monte Carlo
	simulation (in the standard case of a 2-d contigency table).

    o	source() has a new argument `chdir' for changing the working
	directory to that of the file being sourced when evaluating.

    o	If data() loads an R source file, it now changes the working
	directory (to that containing the file) when evaluating.

    o	Interpret strings NaN and Inf in character to numeric conversions
	(and thereby in read.table)

    o	The presence of an object `.conflicts.OK' in a package suppresses
	conflict checking in library() for that package.

    o	uniroot() can now be used recursively.

    o	hdf5{read|write} now allow more kinds of attributes and add support
	for HDF5 version 1.2 (or newer)	thanks to Marcus G. Daniels.
	Configure checks for HDF5 1.2 availability, older versions will 
	no longer work. 



BUG FIXES

    o	x ^ y  gives proper results when x or y are infinite.

    o	The semantics of <<- have been corrected.  The search for
	a variable binding to modify now begins one level "up" from
	the current one.   Thus S and R semantics in "non-closure"
	functions will be identical.

    o	.Last() is called when terminating with q() (not just with EOF).

    o	abline() now understands the "lwd" graphics parameter if it
	is supplied as an inline argument.

    o	axis() now sorts `labels' when it sorts `at'.

    o	Some small changes have made in the axis drawing code to
	ensure that tick-mark label alignment is correct for
	non-default values of the "las" parameter.

    o	Improved error message from check.options().

    o	cm.colors(n) now doesn't append silly "v=1"; works for n=0, n=1.

    o	cooks.distance() now also works for "glm" objects;
	deviance.lm() now ok for the case of weights.

    o	date() doesn't return a final "\n" (again ...).

    o	diag() and diag<- now handle correctly matrices with zero rows or cols.

    o	help([<-.factor) (etc) work again.

    o	is.recursive(list(.)) is now TRUE [PR#221].

    o	log(0) gives -Inf on all architectures.

    o	When persp() was the first graphics command given to R it gave
	the error "plot.new() has not been called yet".  This no
	longer happens.

    o	pgamma() gave 0 or 1 for extreme arguments too soon.

    o	plot(<function>, log="x") doesn't give a silly warning any more.

    o	The internals of postscript() have been changed so that line
	textures (dotted dashed etc) look better.  The use of the
	PostScript "initclip" operator has been removed so that we
	can(?) really claim eps compliance.

    o	revsort() misbehaved if n<=1, causing sample(1,1,,1) to
	segfault

    o	seq(along = v) { and seq(v) when length(v) > 1 } now returns
	a result of mode "integer".

    o	split.default() now uses subscripting for x with a non-null
	class, this preserves, e.g., the class of factors

    o	substr/substring(), deparse(), dput(), dump(), print()
	will work for arbitrarily long strings.

    o	which(x) failed when x had names and contained NAs.

    o	Default editor files (e.g. from fix()) are now removed at termination.

    o	Typos in NegBinomial.Rd (Negative Binomial distrib), thanks to Ch. Gu.

    o	a clipping problem for plots when there non-zero outer margins
	has been fixed.	 This problem used to affect coplot() and pairs().

    o   get("zzz", mode="xxx") missed promise objects.

    o   match.fun failed when a data frame was attached containing a 
	"length" variable (e.g.)

		CHANGES IN R VERSION 0.64.2


NEW FEATURES

    o	new target for R installation testing :	 make strict-tests.

    o	symnum(x) now nicely codes logical x.

    o	convolve() has a new type = c("circular", "open", "filter")
	argument allowing more than the only circular convolution.

    o	par(xpd) now has three settings:  FALSE (clip to plot region),
	TRUE (clip to figure region), or NA (clip to device region).

    o	zapsmall(x) works for complex x.

    o	new global variable R.version.string (for plots & reports).
	Deprecated version & Version for new  R.version & R.Version.

    o	R CMD Rd2dvi  has builtin "Usage" help and works for multiple files.
	Useful for automatic reference manual of a package.
	(doc/manual/lib2tex is more efficient for installed packages, however).


BUG FIXES

    o	power() is now fully implemented and documented.

    o	A couple of problems with group generic operations.

    o	A bug which meant that it was not possible to add elements
	to zero length lists in the obvious way has been fixed.
		x <- list(); x[[1]] <- 10
		x <- list(); x[["a"]] <- 11
	both now work.

    o	save.image() ignored dot-names. (esp. .First())

    o	lab= argument to plot() misinterpreted by axis() via ... passing

    o	NULL labels in text() caused segfault

    o	matrix(f,...) with f a factor now coerces to character

    o	documentation errors for substitute and is.vector, minor fixups for
	trig and nlm

    o	Background colours are set properly on X11 devices with
	colortype="pseudo": sometimes they were not allocated separately.

    o	C() works (again?) for a single argument.

    o	is.na() didn't work properly for "list" arguments.

    o	symnum() sometimes failed with arrays of rank >= 3.

    o	in some cases one could get nonblack color instead of
	black on 2nd x11() window.

    o	influence.measures(.) $ is.influential was wrong on the
	cooks.distance.

    o	printing of complex NaN/Inf was wrong as well.

    o	printing of complex named vectors had a wrong initial space.

    o	allow trailing space in character->numeric coercion

    o	library() gave wrong "masked" warnings in some cases.

    o	par(xpd) semantics were not compatible with S.

    o	rect() output was not clipped in PostScript.

    o	par(pin=c(width, height)) was behaving as par(pin=c(width, width)).

    o	Non-blank separated data files didn't have their 1st field
	handled properly.

    o	"aux" directory moved to "tools" to avoid difficulties on
	Windows.

    o	structure() clobbered factors with missing levels.

    o	pmatch() misbehaved on duplicate matches.

    o	R CMD Rd2dvi <file.Rd> works again.

    o	logical binops tried to set time series parameters before dimensions.

    o	upped the BUFSIZE in model.c (NOT proper long-term solution).

    o	dput(), dump() and deparse()  now always use DBL_DIG (=15) digits
	for numeric formatting.

    o	chull() now works for vertical borders, such as in chull(c(1,1,2),3:1).


		CHANGES IN R VERSION 0.64.1

NEW FEATURES

    o	barplot() and boxplot() are now generic

    o	relevel function to reorder levels in factors.

    o	contr.treatment now has a base= argument for selecting the
	baseline group.

    o	New command line option `--no-environ' (under Unix) to prevent
	sourcing the `~/.Renviron' file.  Implied by `--vanilla'.

    o	Packages can now have a configure script.  If a file `configure'
	is found it is executed before anything else is done by R
	INSTALL.

    o	If HTML help files are asked for but not available, text help
	is used.

    o	HTML help file conversion reports unsatisified \link{..}s.

    o	`vsize' and `nsize' can be set by the environment variables
	R_VSIZE and R_NSIZE respectively, perhaps most conveniently from
	`~/.Renviron' under Unix or Windows.  Command-line settings will
	take precedence.

	The defaults have been increased to 6M and 250k.

    o	zip files can be used for storing help and example files. See
	the help files for "help" and "example" for details.

    o	New submission method "none" (for not sending email) in
	bug.report().

    o	`R CMD check' can now also be used for installed packages without
	the corresponding sources.

    o	The sources for the Windows port are included in src/gnuwin32.
	See src/gnuwin32/readme.

BUG FIXES

    o	deparser left off empty parentheses on e.g. (function(x) x)()

    o	cat() now works on "name" objects

    o	forgot to set jump buffer in return context in one case

    o	parser dropped off tagged missing args on function calls ( f(a=) )

    o	relops tried to set time series parameters before dimensions

    o	arithmetic tried to set time series parameters before dimensions

    o	mvfft fixes (from Martyn Plummer) - not working with vectors and
	segfault problem.

    o	Rephrased error message on invalid assignment target.

    o	ifelse() now evaluates yes/no only if needed

    o	PROTECT'ed some memory in NewExtractNames that was getting overwritten
	during garbage collection.

    o	Crossing factors (`:') works again.

    o	terms.formula used to choke on terms more than 60 characters long

    o	is.nan() should now work correctly on new/old-style lists.

    o	x[[i]] did not work correctly for negative subscripts i.

    o	as.list() didn't work for expressions

    o	x[[i]] <- quote(a) (x generic vector) didn't work

    o	for method functions: many argument name changes, add ... where
	needed, for consistency with the generic function.

    o	example() will allow (again) aliased topic names.

    o	HTML help file conversions will find hyperlinks in the main
	library as well as the current library. Links containing `<'
	or `>' now work properly.

    o	Rdconv conversion of \section{}{}s to Sd corrected.

    o	ppois rounded non-integer `q', should truncate.

    o	pnbinom was wrong for non-integer `q'.

    o	dbinom, dgeom, dnbinom, dpois give 0 with a warning for
	non-integer arguments.

    o	load / save / data allow unlimited string sizes.

    o	strsplit() allows unlimited string size.

    o	eigen() now should work (again) in all cases.

    o	is.nan() fixed to work (again) in architectures with
	"unspecified" internal isnan().


		CHANGES IN R VERSION 0.64.0

NEW FEATURES

    o	Files BUGS and FAQ are now included with distribution and
	various "front matter" files have been cleaned up.

    o	readline has now an argument  prompt = ""

    o	coplot() now labels levels when conditioning variable is factor
	(John Maindonald).

    o	A new function filled.contour() has been added.	 It produces
	a variant of contour plots where the area between contours
	is filled with a solid colour.	The function (currently)
	uses the layout() function and so is restricted to a full
	page display.

    o	The function terrain.colors() has been modified to remove a
	visual discontinuity (at yellow).  In addition, a function
	cm.colors() which implements a Cleveland-style cyan-magenta
	palette has been added.

    o	Primitive function .External() to call dynamically loaded
	`internal'-style functions (code from Jean Meloche).

    o	Function page() to view an R object in a pager.

    o	Support for handling embedded '\n's in text strings
	handed to low-level graphics functions has been added.
	Some changes to the PostScript graphics driver were
	needed to support this, so there may some minor change
	in the appearance of plots produced in PostScript.

    o	The LaTeX documentation is now split into 2 parts: the (currently
	almost non-existent) manual and a reference index.
	Manual: new section on loading C++ code.

    o	[EXPERIMENTAL] Gnome support added. Use ./configure --with-gnome
	to try it, but don't expect too much yet.

    o	HDF5 support improved. Still not perfect, though.

    o	The X11 graphics driver can now use a variety of strategies
	for handing color.  This means that it is now possible to
	use black and white or grayscale graphics on color displays.
	There are two strategies for handing color on pseudocolor
	displays.  The original "allocate-colors-until-they-run-out"
	strategy has been supplemented by one which allocates a
	color cube at startup and approximates requested colors
	by those in the cube.  On truecolor displays, there is no
	limit on the number of colors which can be displayed and
	you get exactly the color you request.	(Note that
	Directcolor and staticcolor displays are not supported yet).

    o	The persp() function now allows shading of the rendered	surface
	using a simple lighting model.

    o	Many functions providing an interface to the operating system
	have been made "platform independent".	See the manual entries
	for "file", "list.files" and "file.show" for details of the new
	interface.  The system.file() interface has been changed.

    o	There is a new function "eval.with.vis" which behaves exactly
	like "eval", but which returns both the result of the evaluation
	an a logical value indicating whether the value is ``visible''.
	This has been used to replace some ad-hoc tests for whether
	value should be printed or not in "source".  As a consequence,
	the "example" and "demo" functions no longer print invisible
	values when the example script is run.

    o	Index files in data directories in packages should be `00Index'
	not `index.doc'.

    o	Function interaction() to compute factor interactions.

    o	load() can load to specific environments.

    o	Sockets interface: make/read/write/close.socket()

    o	Function chull() for planar convex hulls

    o	pairs.formula() allows formula notations for scatter plot matrix.

    o	new dataset co2.

    o	documentation for datasets mtcars, plants, pressure, randu and
	sleep.

    o	the sunspots dataset is now monthly rather than annual.

BUG FIXES

    o	strsplit(), scan() and friends use a much larger char buffer
	 (still fixed size; this will change again)

    o	ts() allows a data-frame argument `data'.

    o	anova.lm handles singular models better, and deparses responses.

    o	dump() now uses digits=12 rather than the current setting.

    o	tabulate ignores entries beyond nbins rather than core dumps.

    o	?.C documents what C/Fortran types R objects correspond to
	in foreign function calls, which is not what everyone thought.

    o	changed long to int in several .C calls to follow the above rules.

    o	rbind(x1,x2) now does not lose dimnames when xi are
	character or complex.

    o	readline() accidentally inherited menu()'s prompt.

    o	.C() and .Fortran() now correctly report that there might be
	NaN/Infs, not just NAs, unless NAOK=TRUE.

    o	Resizing an inactive graphics window to an invalid size left
	that window active and produced a spurious prompt and newline
	in the console window.	This no longer happens.

    o	poly() rescales x to increase accuracy

    o	apply() preserves names in yet another case [-> new example].

    o	phyper() now works for larger arguments than before.

    o	Missing values didn't work in log plot

    o	outer() doesn't produce all-empty dimnames any more

    o	quantile.default() works when `probs' has zero length

    o	example() now works again in all cases [AnIndex spaces].

    o	typos fixed in nlm() message, glm help

    o	pt() now works better for extreme `df' arguments and gives
	at least an approximate answer for ncp > 37.6. __more to change__

    o	fixed some glitches with formatC() and its docs.

    o	several fixes in *.c code to make -Wall happy

    o	curve() [and plot.function()] now use proper `x' values with log="x";
	`type = "."' now works with curve() and plot.function()

    o	zapped old windows files since they didn't build any more.
	The sources for the later gnuwin32 version are expected to
	appear here for 0.64.1. The #ifdef Win32's here are for that
	version.

	`R_LATEXCMD' and `R_DVIPSCMD'.

    o	--vsize & --nsize now both give size in "single units"
	(bytes/cons cells) with possible

    o	[pdqr]negbin() now also work with non-integer 'size' [by Ben Bolker].

    o	New standard package `lqs' for resistant regression and
	covariance estimation, contributed by Brian Ripley.

    o	new functions match.fun() and kronecker() [by Jonathan Rougier]

    o	par(las = 3) is a new option.

    o	new function jitter()  [slightly more useful than S's].

    o	[.factor now retains contrasts attrib.

    o	hist() had trouble with plotting math

    o	HTML indices get only built when installing a package to RHOME

    o	subscripting with a length zero logical no longer bombs.

    o	as.ordered(NULL) now returns an "ordered" object.

    o	--debugger .. now gives a warning if other command line args are used

    o	predict.glm didn't work with se=T

    o	backsolve(), qr.solve... now return a vector when x (or y) is a vector.

    o	string tags now converted to symbols and strange symbolic
	tags print as strings, cf. e<-quote(c(F=2, "tail area" = .5)), etc.

    o	row.names(.) <- val  doesn't allow duplicated values anymore.

    o	library(mva)'s dist() now works with both "euclidean" & "euclidian"

    o	revised curve function to avoid using grep patterns that caused

BUG FIXES

    o	model.frame(,subset=) no longer loses contrasts

    o	`make install' copied the R shell script a second time without

    o	help() after help.start() did not work if topic was not equal
	to filename (e.g. rnorm is found in Normal.html)

    o	fix the 0.63.1 fix for abbreviate(.);  improved doc.

    o	seq() should work better now (fuzz-factor 1e-7 inserted)

    o	multiple arguments to return caused value to be a pairlist

    o	data.frame choked on long names from deparse()

    o	data.edit now works (dataedit doesn't need pairlist()s anymore)

    o	as.pairlist(NULL) is ok

    o	ts(1:5, start=2, end=4) now work.  Further plot(ts(..), ts(..))

    o	eigen() returns $vectors in any case [S compat].

    o	apply(cbind(1,1:9, 2, quantile) doesn't drop quantile names anymore

		CHANGES IN R VERSION 0.63

NEW FEATURES

    o	library(... , warn.conflicts = TRUE)
	now prints all conflicts arising from attaching the given package.

    o	new  .Platform	variable  for better modularizing
	platform dependence. __This_is_"beta"_and_bound_to_be_changed___

    o	new arguments to colnames(..) and
	rownames(x, do.NULL = TRUE, prefix = "row").
			   _
    o	par(bty = "]") for _| box(.) in plots.

    o	New standard package `modreg' (smoothing and local MODern
	REGression methods) contributed by B.D. Ripley.

    o	par() has a `no.readonly = FALSE' argument which allows more
	sensible  op <- par(no.readonly = TRUE);  on.exit(par(op)).

    o	Real Bessel functions of 1st to 3rd kind, of arbitrary order:
	besselI(), besselK(), besselJ(), besselY() are the I(), K(),
	J(), and Y() Bessel functions.

    o	New conflicts() function from B.D. Ripley

    o	uniroot has a new `maxiter' argument and returns #{iter} and
	precision.

    o	New option `show.coef.Pvalue' (default: TRUE).	If FALSE,
	print.summary.[g]lm does not print P values.

    o	New `R --vanilla' is equivalent to
	  R --no-save --no-restore --no-site-file --no-init-file

    o	gc() has now a `verbose' argument and returns a matrix with free
	and total n- and v-cells(heap).

    o	New example(<foo>) function runs the \emph{Examples} R code of
	<foo>.	example() calls source() which now has a `verbose'
	instead of `debug' argument.

    o	experimental functions [as.|is.|]pairlist() for the few old-style
	dotted pair lists [undocumented].

    o	options(check.bounds = TRUE) makes sub-assignments which
	"stretch" a vector give a warning [dropped undocumented
	check.bounds() function].

    o	Makefiles should now conform (mostly) with the GNU Coding
	Standards.  In particular, `make install', `make uninstall'
	and `make install-strip' now work.
	Also, it is now possible to build R in a non-source directory.

    o	which() preserves names and has a new `arr.ind' argument
	allowing for array indices.

    o	New functions {d,p,q,r}signrank for the Wilcoxon signed rank
	distribution, and {d,p,q,r}wilcox for the Wilcoxon (rank sum)
	distribution.

    o	Command line options GNUified a bit further.
	New command line option `--verbose' for printing more
	information about progress.
	Command line options `--vsize' and `--hsize' as replacements
	for `-v' and `-n' which are now deprecated.
	Added `--silent' as synonym for `--quiet'.
	Short-style option `-V' obsolete.

    o	Added bug.report() to generate & send bug reports from
	within R.

    o	The PostScript device driver now uses the ISO Latin1 font
	encoding.  This should allow Western Europeans to render
	their languages correctly.  It is likely that additional
	encodings will be added (e.g. Latin2) when we figure out
	how to set the correct font encoding in printers.

    o	The mathematical annotation code has been reworked.  Italic
	correction works better.  Additional functionality will be
	added.

    o	"sample" now has an optional "prob" argument which gives the
	probabilities of sampling each element in the vector being
	sampled.  The present implementation is based on some code
	from E. S. Venkatraman <venkat@biosta.mskcc.org>.

    o	The internal data structure used to represent lists has
	changed from being based on dotted pairs to generic vectors.
	Users should see no changes as a result (with the exception
	of some efficiency gains in list operations).

    o	Subscripting matches that of S more closely.  It is now
	possible to use subscripting beyond that the end of vectors
	and lists.

    o	Element labelling in "c" and "unlist" should match that of
	of S.

    o	Added split.screen etc functions for manipulating multiple
	screens on a single device

    o	After help.start() the HTML help system is used for all help()
	requests. The name of the browser is now controlled by
	options("browser").

    o	Added kmeans to package mva (donated by B. Ripley)

    o	New persp function added.  It is NOT compatible with S (yet)
	and is subject to internal and interface changes.

    o	gctorture() for torturing the garbage collector to reveal
	memory protection bugs. (Call GC on every memory allocation).

    o	B. Ripley's aov code (and more) has been added. This includes:

	- aov() now handles models with Error terms, multiple
	  responses.

	- proj(), model.tables(), se.contrast(), replications(),
	  eff.aovlist() are implemented for aov fits, and where
	  appropriate for lm fits.

	- dummy.coef(), with methods for lm and aovlist fits.

	- add1(), drop1(), step() for stepwise fitting of statistical
	  models, with default, lm and glm methods.

	- summary() and deviance() -- mlm methods.

	- kappa()  (for estimating condition numbers)

	- labels() to find a suitable set of labels from an object

	- C() for setting the contrasts of a factor

	- anova(), plot(), summary() and deviance() methods for mlm fits

    o	eval() semantics changed when envir= is a list. A 3rd argument is
	now allowed, specifying the enclosure (i.e. where R looks for
	variables *not* found in envir=) it defaults to the calling
	environment (was .GlobalEnv). Note that when used inside a function,
	it is often desirable to set the enclosure to the parent
	environment instead. [ eval(e, data, sys.frame(sys.parent())) ]


BUG FIXES

    o	min(NULL); max(double())  now give warnings.  range() gives NA.

    o	substring("", NULL) no longer segfaults.

    o	formatC(.) now takes default "width = 1" when both width and digits
	are unspecified.

    o	several fixes in internal axis and tickmarks setup for
	"extreme" ranges and values, especially for "log" scaling.

    o	seq(a,a, by=b) now works properly.

    o	print.data.frame(.) now calls print.matrix instead of print(.)
	which finally enables the 'right = TRUE' argument.

    o	R --help  gives more

    o	postscript() now uses 'hyphen' instead of 'plusminus' for a minus.

    o	source(..., echo=TRUE) now puts a `"' if necessary after truncation.

    o	Changes to the PostScript device driver mean that the volume
	of output has been reduced to about a third of what it was.

    o	Fixes and restructuring to name generation in connection with
	unlist() and c().

    o	Many bugs found and fixed in the memory allocation / garbage
	collection area. In particular, the parser was sometimes
	UNPROTECT()ing the wrong pointers.

    o	lm(y[g=="1"]~x[g=="1"]) caused memory corruption


		CHANGES IN R VERSION 0.62.4
BUG FIXES

    o	plot.default(.) has now 'sub' argument which eliminates
	"Warning: parameter "sub" couldn't be set in high-level plot() function"

    o	formatC(numeric(0)) now works.

    o	menu(.) works for empty imput

    o	0i ^ 2	now gives  0+0i as it should.

    o	ppoints() now behaves like S, and has additional argument 'a'

    o	seq(1,6,by=3) and similar "by" calls now work okay

    o	mahalanobis(.) now fixed; does *NOT* have default arguments for
	center and cov anymore.

    o	diag(.) doesn't return non-sensical dimnames anymore.


		CHANGES IN R VERSION 0.62.3

NEW FEATURES

    o	preserve factor levels and contrast settings in model objects

    o	factor[...,drop=T] reduces level set

    o	added dblepr, intpr

    o	do_modelmatrix(model.c): Set rownames from data argument.

    o	New generic function preplot().

    o	A new R BATCH interface for non-interactive execution.

    o	Added `offline' argument to help() for producing hardcopy via
	latex and dvips.

    o	glm.fit.null now calculates AIC and print.glm.null prints it

    o	effects.lm implemented

    o	new class "mlm" for multivariate "lm", predict.mlm to go with it

    o	"Details" section added to .Rd format

    o	R_PRINTCMD and R_PAPERSIZE can now be set via users' environment,
	overriding setting in startup script.

    o	enhanced identify()

    o	new function print.coefmat()

    o	added unix() as .Deprecated("system")

    o	date() replacing system.date()


BUG FIXES

    o	substitute would re-substitute after expanding ...

    o	indexing modified object in some cases

    o	sweep should work again on dataframes

    o	minor changes in aov()

    o	builds should now actually work on systems that do not add
	underscores to Fortran symbols

    o	biplot[.default]() was redundant in "base" package; now only in "mva".

    o	unix(..) now helps the user to find  system(..) instead.

    o	apropos("[") and methods("[") now both work (even though "[" is not
	a valid regular expression).

    o	row.names<-.default now exists. Converts object to data
	frame and then adds row names

    o	codes() now distinguishes between ordered and unordered factors

    o	codes() had *opposite* semantics of Splus. Now it's the same.

    o	replicating factors now yields factors (again)

    o	print.summary.xxx  functions more consistent, using new function
	print.coefmat().

    o	Changed many `T' to `TRUE'  and	 `F' to `FALSE' in the base package.

    o	binary operation on 1x1 matrix lost dimension

    o	fix anova.glm for null model

    o	glm.fit.null: ensure df.residual == df.null for a null model

    o	summary.glm: correlations in saturated cases

    o	stat.anova: use match.arg and labeled switch statement

    o	Major cleanup of glm iteration code

    o	Correct reordering of glm coefficients if pivoting

    o	Rownames on contrast matrices

    o	factor() and [.factor preserves class "ordered"

    o	Code rearrangement in predict.lm (avoid unnecessary computation)
	+ let rownames through on predictions

    o	model.matrix.default: Initial code to define model frame
	simplified considerably after defaulting data argument to
	sys.frame(sys.parent()).  This also removes the problem where
	data.frame mangles I(x^2) and similar names, so that the
	"reorder" sanity check at the end fails.

    o	The handling of extra FORTRAN libraries (f2c-related and BLAS)
	should now be correct.	Via SHLIBLDFLAGS, add-ons will also be
	linked against these libraries.

    o	Modified makefiles so configure followed by "make distclean"
	should restore the source tree to its original form.

    o	a leftover "colours <- colors" caused trouble when collating
	sequence changes caused files to go into the "base" file in a
	different order

		CHANGES IN R VERSION 0.62.2

(The new functions predict.glm, poly, aov, alias, biplot.default and
biplot.princop, update.default and rug all come from Brian D. Ripley,
who is also responsible for finding and/or fixing a lot of the bugs)

NEW FEATURES

    o	predict.glm() added.

    o	text() is generic.

    o	update.default() (replaces update.glm() and update.lm()).
	(This will only work if you comment out update.lm and
	update.glm in the sources, or disable them with
	update.lm<-function(object,...)NextMethod(), etc.)

    o	predict.lm() changed towards S-plus compatibility. Intervals are
	still available via interval= argument.

    o	zapsmall() function.

    o	polygon() now handles NAs

    o	options(show.signif.stars = TRUE).  If FALSE,
	summary.lm and similar functions do *not* print significance stars
	anymore.

    o	poly() for [g]lm modelling.

    o	aov()	for Analysis Of Variance [anova].

    o	alias() for displaying ``aliased'' factor levels in (>=2)way anova.

    o	mva: Now has  biplot and biplot.princomp

    o	rug() plot.

    o	new  src/library/profile/Common.R   for	 OS-independent intialization.

    o	new date stamp mechanism (ensures that prerelease versions carry
	correct date)

BUG FIXES

    o	abbreviate() now always retains the first letter.

    o	attr() partial matches for attribute name.

    o	axis() accepts graphical parameters.

    o	binomial() accepts factor responses.

    o	cbind() works with data frames.

    o	contrasts() gives simpler labels (like S) for factors with
	two levels.

    o	contrasts<-() now has a how.many= argument.

    o	contour() and image() can accept a list to specify the matrix.

    o	contr.poly() uses orthogonal polynomials (like S) not raw
	polynomials.

    o	data() could fail with a partial match to the dataset name.

    o	density() works correctly if from= or to= are used.
	    n= can now take any value, not just a large power of 2.

    o	expand.grid() now accepts more than two arguments,
	or a list of factors.

    o	factor() and ordered() handle their levels argument better.

    o	family.glm() now returns the correct family (including link etc).

    o	legend() now knows about lwd.

    o	match.args() works correctly for default arguments.

    o	model.frame.lm() did not invoke `lm'.

    o	model.matrix() calls model.frame() if needed.

    o	model.response() now returns names, so glm() gives names to
	residuals, fitted values, etc.

    o	quasi() works in glm() (was missing aic component).

    o	seq() sometimes omitted the final value due to rounding error.

    o	terms.formula() and update.formula() now resolve `.' in formulae
	and tidy up `(a + b) - b' etc.

    o	... is now passed down correctly to functions inside functions.

    o	save.image didn't work (Martyn Plummer)

    o	abs() instead of fabs() in seq.c crashed R on Digital Unix

    o	model.matrix() gagged on variables with complicated names

    o	saturated models acting up in glm

    o	various improvement of build procedures

    o	rbind(NULL, matrix) core dump

    o	density() default 'bw' now 0.9*(...) instead of 1.06*(...)
				[=Silverman's rule of thumb].

    o	detach(2) now works.

    o	format() doesn't drop names anymore.

    o	format.pval() works with NAs.

    o	print.[summary.][g]lm() functions print numbers better formatted.

    o	legend() now also works properly in  log coordinates.

    o	backsolve() now working;  bakslv.c not depending on
	Fortran_underscores.

    o	Tick marks acting up on log axes in postscript (fix from Martyn
	Plummer)

    o	The Rd format has a new section \details{} (needed for proper
	Sd2Rd translation). \R was not understood for nroff
	conversions, longer dashes (-- and --- in latex syntax) are
	now converted properly.

    o	prompt.default() now carries "\details{}".

    o	R [ SHLIB | COMPILE ] were broken on some Solaris systems
	due to use of bash syntax. R [ INSTALL | COMPILE | SHLIB ]
	now use a MAKE environment variable if present.
	R INSTALL only rebuilds man pages if they are not already
	up to date.


		CHANGES IN R VERSION 0.62.1

BUG FIXES

    o	Accidentally shipped R-0.62 without the tests and  etc/Rdoc
	directories.


		CHANGES IN R VERSION 0.62

NEW FEATURES

    o	Many more help(.) pages.

    o	The top level Makefile now supports the usual
	   ./configure; make; make install
	procedure (new make targets `all' and `install').

    o	The HTML help pages can now be searched for keywords.

    o	Conversion of functions to and from lists. formals<- and body<-.
	The alist() function makes it easier to construct argument lists,
	etc. Added expression-->list coercion.

    o	complex(.) now has optional 'argument' and 'modulus' arguments,
	allowing ``polar coordinate'' specifications.

    o	layout() documented and improved: starts default device if needed, and
	returns number of figures.

    o	New find() function [relying on apropos(..)].

    o	objects(<integer>) now works, being equivalent to
	objects(pos=<int.>).

    o	storage.mode() and related functions now return
	"double" instead of "real", for compatibility.
	"real" is still allowed as synomym for "double".

    o	A `tests' directory has been added (in the source), and "make
	tests" has been modified to run more than all the examples from
	the base package.  The exact `make tests' behavior is still
	bound to change.

    o	An experimental directory `etc/Rdoc' has been added with a perl5
	module to parse R documentation files.	Sample perl programs
	to use this module are also included.

    o	All internal mechanisms to support factors and data.frames have
	been removed.  These are now entirely supported by interpreted
	code!  `is.unordered' has been eliminated.  Thanks to John
	Chambers for allowing the distribution of his StatLib code.

    o	"pmatch" is now completely S compatible and is not just another
	name for "charmatch".

    o	There is now a function called ".Alias" which can be used to
	provide multiple names for the same object.  Example:
		lm2 <- .Alias(lm)
	This is dangerous because it can be used to defeat the
	call-by-value illusion.

    o	Many functions changed from <primitive> to .Internal(..).
	Currently, new .Internal(.)s in ..library/base/R/New-Internal.R
	Primitive functions are now printed as ``.Primitive(..)''.

    o	[dpqr]hyper(.) now also work with some 0 arguments.

    o	C-code: Many "-Wall" fixes (MM & DB).

    o	mva's dist() now takes arguments diag and upper which control
	how the distance matrix is printed. plot.hclust() now takes a
	labels argument.

    o	Attributes are now propagated correctly in binary operations.
	Changes from:
	  Steve Oncley and Gordon Maclean
	  National Center for Atmospheric Research
	  Boulder, Colorado USA

    o	configure now also checks for fort77.

    o	Usage of R INSTALL now is
	  R INSTALL [options] [-l lib] pkg_1 ... pkg_n
	The +/- options were replaced by GNU-style `--no-docs' and
	`--no-text', `--no-html', and `--no-latex'.

    o	Usage of R REMOVE now is
	  R REMOVE [options] [-l lib] pkg_1 ... pkg_n

    o	Usage of R COMPILE now is R COMPILE [options] srcfiles, where
	through options one can set e.g. CFLAGS or FFLAGS.

    o	Usage of R SHLIB now is R SHLIB [-o libname] files, where the
	file names can be that of source or object files.

    o	A new R CMD interface allows invokation of executables in
	$RHOME/{etc,cmd} without installing them or setting paths.

    o	Data files are now also documented using the Rd format, all
	data documentation in the base package has been converted
	accordingly. Rd files for data have a \keyword{datasets} as
	identifier.

    o	new function mahalanobis() for Mahalanobis distance

    o	quantile.default() now handles Inf's correctly.

    o	New command line options `--enable-blas' and `--enable-readline'
	to configure.

    o	pretty(x) is more reasonable when max(x)-min(x) < 1e-10 max(|x|),
	and has a new argument "shrink.sml" for that case.

    o	formatC(.) supports a new "fg" format for flexible
	non-exponential formatting.

    o	etc/build-htmlpkglist has been integrated into etc/build-help
	(option --htmllists)

    o	family	gaussian(.) and inverse.gaussian(.) both accept several
	link arguments [J.Lindsey].

    o	The graphics function "tck" now produces effects just
	like those in S (e.g. par(tck=1) now produces grid lines).
	Since using "tck" produces nasty results in some circumstances
	there is also an alternative parameter "tcl" which defines
	the tick length in terms of lines of text.  The default
	setting is par(tcl=-0.5).

    o	menu() now takes additional arguments `graphics' (currently
	unused) and `title'.

    o	New function plot.formula().
	plot.factor() now produces boxplots when given 2 arguments.

    o	New function write.table().

    o	signif() now has a `digits' default of 6.

    o	Old-style long command line options (`-save' etc) changed to
	GNU-style (`--save' etc).
	Debugging options (`-ddd', `-gdb', `-xxgdb') unified into the
	new `--debugger' (`-d').
	New command line options `--version' (`-V') and `--help' (`-h')
	which print useful information and exit.

    o	The loading of profiles at startup now works as follows.
	Unless the new `--no-site-file' was given, a site profile is
	sought (as specified via the environment variable `RPROFILE',
	or if this is unset defaulting to `${RHOME}/etc/Rprofile'.
	Then, unless the new `--no-init-file' was given, the user
	profiles (`.Rprofile' and `~/.Rprofile') are sought.

    o	New functions subset() and transform() intended primarily to
	make life with dataframes easier.

    o	debian directory has been added so Debian GNU/Linux packages can be
	created from raw source.

    o	The graphics system has been through a major overhaul.
	It is now possible to have multiple active device drivers
	and to control them with full suite of dev.xxx() functions
	available in S.	 Display lists are now kept for interactive
	devices.  When an on-screen graphics window is resized,
	the content of that window is redrawn at the new size.
	At present only X11 and PostScript graphics device drivers
	are available, but more are on the way.

    o	On systems using IEEE arithmetic, the builtin Inf and NaN
	values are now recognised and used.  NA and NaN should
	propagate correctly in computations, with NA dominating
	in computations involving both quantities.
	E.g. NA+NaN is NA.

    o	Some of the t, F, and chisq distribution/probability functions
	now allow a noncentrality parameter `ncp'.

    o	Functions ptukey() and qtukey() provide the distribution and
	quantile functions for the maximum of several studentized
	ranges.

    o	system.file()  [now documented] returns all files matched by
	wildcards.

    o	data() now supports more file formats: .RData for binary
	files, .txt or .tab for data to be read by
	`read.table(file, header=TRUE)' and .csv for data to be read
	by `read.table(file, header=TRUE, sep=";")'

    o	Rdconv: new tabular environment, new sections `\format' and
	`\source', new output format `-type Sd' for S documentation

    o	.First.lib() now implemented; called by library() after loading
	a package.

    o	print.summary.[g]lm() now give `significance stars' and a symbolic
	correlation matrix.

    o	new is.R() function.

    o	glm() now also returns an AIC value [from JL].
	print..glm methods indicate the options()$contrasts in some cases.
	In summary.glm(..., correlation=..), the default has been changed to
	corr. = FALSE  which is consistent with	 summary.lm().
	predict() now works again for glm objects.

	character.

    o	new design of HTML help pages, including an index of all
	functions from all installed packages.

    o	new editor function pico()

    o	matrices and arrays can have zero extents

    o	[pq]tukey(.) now working.

    o	title() now handles main=, sub=, xlab=, ylab= with embedded

	partly a change in the underlying graphics code.

    o	min(.), max(.), sum(.)	now return integer for integer arguments.

    o	which(.) now returns integer.

    o	Rd files: leading whitespace of lines in user-defined sections

    o	R INSTALL should work (again) now when `pkg' is a relative file
	name.

    o	.not.yet.implemented() now takes an arbitrary number of args.

    o	Plotting of dendrograms is working again.

    o	data.frame(.) now uses "1:n" as default row.names.

    o	format(NULL) now works.

    o	minor fix in symnum.

    o	hist() now is more compatible to S, has a new `labels' argument,
	and should work ok for non-equidistant breaks.

    o	plot(-1) now labels properly.

    o	Many small code changes (eliminating extraneous variables, nested
	comm.) in C code in order to satisfy `gcc -Wall' [Doug Bates].

    o	model.extract() will now extract arbitrary model frame arguments.


    o	list of currently loaded libraries (.Dyn.libs) not saved
	from session to session (really, this time)

    o	rhyper works with vectorisation, degenerate cases.

    o	printing of objects in lists now dispatches methods correctly

		CHANGES IN R VERSION 0.61.2

BUG FIXES

	pretty(.) now sometimes returns different results than before.

    o	pi:6  returned integer, instead of real.

    o	[.data.frame caused segfault if called with non-dataframe argument

    o	hist() now is more compatible to S, has a new `labels' argument,

    o	formatC(pi,dig=20,wid=2) segfaulted.

    o	quantile(..., pr = c(1,2,5)/1000)  gave all names as "0%".

    o	In 0.61.1, model.matrix was fixed to pay attention to the names of
	the names of its data arg, but the data arg was defaulting to an
	unnamed list, so  model.matrix(~x)  failed...

    o	Indexing with [[]] and a zero-length vector segfaulted.

    o	Coercion of factors as in S-plus

    o	dyn.load statement in demos/dynload/zero.R fixed

    o	Factors could get allocated without the OBJECT bit, which
	nearly drove Kurt mad trying to write plot.factor...

		CHANGES IN R VERSION 0.61.1

NEW FEATURES

    o	None (by definition, x.y.z releases are bugfix releases now)

BUG FIXES

    o	Return statements of the form return(x,y) will now return
	a list with named components.

    o	Parsing of nested "if" statments was broken.  This is fixed now.
	(Reported by Paul Gilbert).

	in Irix (George White <gwhite@bodnext.bio.dfo.ca>)

    o	if(nmatch = 0) bug in src/main/character.c fixed (Doug Bates)

    o	R_alloc/S_alloc fixes. The former allocated 4 times more than
	needed, the latter zeroed half of what it got, sizeof() mistakes
	in both cases.

	library on loading

    o	The pager ate the rest of stdin in batch mode, now fixed. Also,
	stdout was not flushed before call to system(). "make tests"
	should work now.

    o	Empty directories now created by configure (so that it doesn't
	matter that "CVS export" doesn't do it)

    o	as.name() made idempotent (i.e. if is.name(x) then as.name(x)==x)

    o	3 problems with glm, 2 in glm.fit and a one in print.glm fixed
	[Jim Lindsey]

	numbers.

    o	seq(.) doesn't segfault anymore in  gl(2,3):gl(1,6)

    o	contour(.) now also works with integer arguments


		CHANGES IN R VERSION 0.61

We try to make development more flexible by creating a "CVS branch". This
should make it easier to produce patches for obvious bugs in the releases,
without having to wait for changes in other areas to stabilize.

NEW FEATURES

    o	New functions "all.vars" and "all.names" added.

    o	There has been a small change in the include file structure.
	All include files now live in RHOME/src/include and are
	copied to RHOME/include when needed.

    o	The "noquote" functions are now documented.

    o	A new `language' demo, "is.things", is provided.

    o	symnum(.) function

	a zero length call has been fixed.

    o	model.matrix(.) now allows a  contrasts argument.

    o	barplot(.) now also works for barplot(table(rpois(100,3))).

    o	make clean ; make    now should work;  ./Makefile.in eliminated

    o	format(.) is now generic;  the default method has a `digits' argument.


		CHANGES IN R VERSION 0.60.1

NEW FEATURES

    o	"split" is now a generic function, with a method for data frames.
	(contributed by Doug Bates).

    o	S compatible functions "all.names" and "all.vars" added.



BUG FIXES

    o	A file was closed multiple times if an error message occurred
	after sourcing a file.	In some versions of Linux this caused
	a core dump.

    o	The inclusion <readline/history.h> was causing problems with
	some versions of readline because the file did not exist.
	This is now detected by configure.



		CHANGES IN R VERSION 0.60

R is about to become an official part of the GNU project.
To quote RMS (Richard Stallman)

		``I hereby dub R GNU software!''


NEW FEATURES

    o	There has been a major change in directory structure
	masterminded by Kurt Hornik.
	library(.) now attaches ``package''s which are better
	integrated, see "?library".  Packages may be available from outside
	the RHOME path via the .lib.loc variable.

    o	The documentation format (of files in src/library/<package>/man/ )
	has changed to a more easily parsable LaTeX like format.
	The doc files now all end in `.Rd'.
	etc/Rman2Rd  can be used to translate old-style documentation to
	the new one.
	The translation to *roff, LaTeX and HTML is now done using
	etc/Rdconv, written in Perl by Fritz Leisch.

	The HTML online help produced has now links which work.
	The manual (in doc/manual/) now includes a section on the
	documentation format and on mathematical text in graphs.

	etc/ further contains `Sd2Rd' for (partial) translation of S `.d'
	documentation to Rd, and
	`Rd2txt' and `Rd2dvi' for easy previewing of single Rd files.

    o	The use of "names" on one dimensional arrays will now produce
	sensible results.  This means that for most purposes,
	one dimensional arrays can be treated like vectors.

    o	We have a applied a patch from mward@wolf.hip.berkeley.edu
	which should substantially improve the speed of (vector)
	arithmetic.

    o	The modeling formula handler has been expanded so that it
	accepts y ~ 0 + x as a "through the origin" specification.
	models with no parameters are now acceptable.

    o	"cov", "cor" and "var" now produce a matrix result if either
	of their x or y arguments is a matrix.	Dimnames are propagated
	in a sensible fashion.

    o	New chisq.test(.) and prop.test() from Kurt Hornik.

    o	New read.fwf(.) for reading fixed width format (KH).

    o	New str(.) [alternative to summary(.) for programmers] (MM).

    o	New example data sets "esoph", "infert" and "anscombe" (TL),
	"iris3" (KH) and "stackloss" (MM).

    o	source(.) has several new arguments, notably ``echo = FALSE''.
	This is applied in the new function  demo(.) which runs all the
	code in demos/ (but dynload).

    o	strheight(.) is new, accompanying strwidth(.).
	Both now work for mathematical expressions (Paul Murrell).

    o	The LaTeX version of the manual (-> doc/manual/) now has an index.

    o	EVERY *.Rd file in src/library/base/man/ has now at least one \keyword

    o	New package (`library(.)') "stepfun" for step functions, incl.
	empirical distributions.


BUG FIXES

    o	Regular expression matching is now done with system versions
	of the regexp library.	This should fix compilation problems
	on some platforms.

    o	"approx" and "approxfun", have had some minor adjustments.
	which fix the interpretation of the rule= argument.  The
	code for piecewise constant case is now internal C code
	that than interpreted.	This should boost performance in
	this case.

    o	There has been a minor fixup of "model.frame" to ensure that
	subsets, weights, etc are handled properly.

    o	Model fitting of the form

		 lm(y~., data=df)
		glm(y~., data=df)

	will now work.	The RHS of the model will consist of an
	additive model containing all (non-response) variables in the
	given data frame.

    o	The following type of assignment to data frame subsets

		z <- data.frame(x=rnorm(10),y=rnorm(10),z=rnorm(10))
		z[,1:2] <- matrix(1:20,nc=2)

	was producing incorrect results.  The solution was to wrap
	an implicit "as.data.frame" around the RHS.

    o	"[.data.frame" no longer has a default drop=TRUE argument.
	This means that subsetting a data frame with "[" will always
	yield a data frame.

    o	There was a swap of coordinates internally in "mtext" which
	meant that labels were coming out in the wrong place.  Fixed.

    o	Syntax errors in parse(text="...") would cause R to terminate
	with a segmentation violation.	This no longer happens, although
	the result is still not perfect (the parse() returns).
	This will be fixed by a future parse rewrite.

    o	rainbow, topo.colors, etc., now also work with n in {1,2};
	don't return duplicate neighbor colors anymore.

    o	legend has new `text.width' argument and now also works with
	mathematical expressions as text.

    o	hist() now works better, has a `plot = TRUE' argument, and returns
	something useful.

    o	barplot() improved for `names', now returns vector of midpoints.

    o	lm(), lm.fit, lm.wfit (was `lm.w.fit'):	 Made more compatible.
	Dealing with (close to) collinear situations is still not flexible
	enough.

    o	internal postscript() improved (missing lines in boxplot(.)).

    o	Improvement to many (even most ?) documentation (.Rd) files.

    o	Numerous other fixes of minor things ...



		  CHANGES IN R VERSION 0.50

WARNING!!!

 o  A change in the way that "expressions" are implemented means that
    saved data images which contain expressions will probably not
    restore properly.

NEW FEATURES

 o  The installation of documentation has now been streamlined.
    Many manual entries have been revised.

 o  "expressions" are now implemented as a basic type rather than as
    a class of object.	This change was made as move toward compatibility
    with S and also to implement mathematical annotation in graphs.
    For some examples of the latter, see ?text and ?title.

 o  "eigen" can now handle complex and non-symmetric matrices.

 o  Libraries are now attached by loading their code into newly created
    environment frames on the search path rather than in with the general
    system code.  This means that libraries can be unloaded as well as
    loaded.  They can also have .First.lib and .Last.lib functions.
    The variable .Libraries has been replaced by .library() but should not
    be needed much anymore.

 o  There is now an experimental function called "delay" which creates
    a promise to evaluate an expression.  This provides direct access
    to the lazy evaluation mechanism used by R.

 o  >>>>  'make tests'	 allows to test--run all the help() examples.

 o  New functions   matplot / matpoints / matlines.

 o  cut has 2 new arguments. 'right = TRUE' gives intervals closed on the
	right, open to the left (as S); 'right = FALSE' allows to reverse
	this. The code for default label construction has been enhanced,
	and can be controlled by the new argument 'dig.lab'.

 o  legend(.) has 2 new arguments 'cex' (obvious) and 'merge = FALSE'.
	-> ?legend.
 o  deparse  has a 2nd argument allowing for a kind of line width.
 o  There is now print.density (method).

 o  many help(.) pages have been updated with working examples,
	and several new ones have been created.

 o  influence.measures() and lm.influence now allow to get at the usual
    regression diagnostics.

BUG FIXES

 o  The "is.object" function has been with drawn.

 o  A bug which prevented the "pictex" graphics driver from working
    has been fixed.

 o  Regression diagnostics obtained with "lm.influence" now work when
    there are weights.	This means they should work for glms.

 o  There was a problem in parsing files from statements which were
    separated from following statements by ";" (e.g. data(iris); iris).
    This is fixed.

 o  Comments are handled better in functions.  The rule is that they
    are shifted to just before their statements.  Comments after the
    last statement of a function are lost.

 o  It is now possible to perform complicated mutations of expressions.
    For example
	e <- quote(f(x=1,y=2))
	names(e)[[2]] <- "a"
    will change the x= argument tag into a=.  In the past this produced
    odd error messages.

 o  The length function now tries to return a "sensible" value for all
    the built-in types.	 For example, symbols now have length 1.

 o  "update" should now work in both "lm" and "glm" models.

 o  The functions Re, Im, Mod, Arg and Conj will now accept real-valued
    arguments and return the obvious results.

 o  Minor graphics cleanup.

 o  A fix for convergence problems in glm from Thomas Lumley included.

 o  A new version of qt() should not take infinitely long to get an
    answer in the large degrees if freedom case.  The underlying code
    (Hill 1970, CACM) appears to be much faster and more accurate than
    Splus.

 o  A final Newton step has been added to give a final "polish" to
    the quantiles produced by pnorm().	These should be close to full
    accuracy now.

 o  A bug in qbeta found by Martin Maechler has been fixed.  This should
    speed up quantile computation for the F and Beta distributions.
    Further improvements in qbeta(.) by MM.  No infinite loops anymore.

 o  rainbow(.) now allows "start > end" indexing the "color circle".
    topo.colors(n), terrain.colors(n), heat.colors(n) now also work for n=1,2.

 o  ?"+" now works.

 o  tapply has been fixed as indicated by T. Lumley.
