		CHANGES IN R VERSION 2.1.0


USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o	box plots {by boxplot() or bxp()} now have the median line three
	times the normal line width in order to distinguish it from the
	quartile ones.


NEW FEATURES

    o	Faster algorithm in summaryRprof().

    o	na.contiguous() is now (S3) generic with first argument
	renamed to 'object'.

    o	Plotmath now allows underline in expressions.  (PR#7286,
	contributed by Uwe Ligges.)

    o	BATCH on Unix no longer sets --gui="none" as the X11 module
	is only loaded if needed.

    o	The X11 module (and the hence X11(), jpeg() and png() devices
	and the X-based dataentry editor) is now in principle
	available under all Unix GUIs except --gui="none", and this is
	reflected in capabilities().

	capabilities("X11") determines if an X server can be accessed,
	and so is more likely to be accurate.

    o	binomial() has a new "cauchit" link (suggested by Roger Koenker).

    o	ecdf() now has jumps of the correct size (a multiple of 1/n)
	if there are ties.  (Wished by PR#7292).

    o	Printing of arrays now honours the 'right' argument if there
	are more than two dimensions.

    o	Tabular printing of numbers now has headers right-justified, as
	they were prior to version 1.7.0 (spotted by Rob Baer).

    o	dir.create() has a new argument 'recursive' serving the same
	purpose as Unix's mkdir -p.

    o	scatter.smooth() and loess.smooth() now handle missing values
	in their inputs.

    o	Added colorRamp() and colorRampPalette() for color interpolation.

    o	New argument 'immediate.' to warning() to send an immediate
	warning.

    o	file.append() has been tuned, including for the case of
	appending many files to a single file.

    o	subset() now has a method for matrices, similar to that for
	data frames.

    o	R CMD check will now work on a source tarball and prints out
	information about the version of R and the package.

    o	New function recordGraphics() to encapsulate calculations
	and graphics output together on graphics engine display list.
	To be used with care.

    o	kmeans() now returns an object of class "kmeans" which has a
	print() method.

	Two alternative algorithms have been implemented.

	If the number of centres is supplied, it has a new option of
	multiple random starts.

    o	is.all.equal() convenience function to be used for programming.

    o	unclass() is no longer allowed for environments and external
	pointers (since these cannot be copied and so unclass() was
	destructive of its argument).  You can still change the
	"class" attribute.

    o	choose(n,k) and lchoose(.) now also work for arbitrary (real) n in
	accordance with the general binomial theorem.  choose(*,k) is more
	accurate (and faster) for small k.

    o	as.dist() and cophenetic() are now generic, and the latter has a
	new method for objects of class "dendrogram".

    o	New function convertColors() maps between color spaces.
	colorRamp() uses it.

    o	as.ts() is now generic.

    o	legend() now accepts positioning by keyword, e.g. "topleft",
	and can put a title within the legend.	(Suggested by Elizabeth
	Purdom in PR#7400.)

    o	Lazy-loading databases are now cached in memory at first use:
	this enables R to run much faster from slow file systems such
	as USB flash drives.  There is a small (less than 2Mb)
	increase in default memory usage.

    o	The implicit class structure for numeric vectors has been
	changed, so that integer/real vectors try first methods for
	class "integer"/"double" and then those for class "numeric".

	The implicit classes for matrices and arrays have been changed
	to be "matrix"/"array" followed by the class(es) of the
	underlying vector.

    o	A new function getGraphicsEvent() has been added which will allow
	mouse or keyboard input from a graphics device. (NB: currently
	only the Windows screen device supports this function.	This
	should improve before the 2.1.0 release.)

    o	%% now warns if its accuracy is likely to be affected by lack
	of precision (as in 1e18 %% 11, the unrealistic expectation of
	PR#7409), and tries harder to return a value in range when it is.

    o	splines::splineDesign() now allows to evaluate a B-spline basis
	everywhere instead of just inside the "inner" knots, by setting the
	new argument `outer.ok = TRUE'.

    o	plot.data.frame() tries harder to produce sensible plots for
	non-numeric data frames with one or two columns.

    o	nchar() returns the true number of characters stored
	(including any embedded nuls), this being 2 for missing values.

    o	all/any() now attempt to coerce their arguments to logical, as
	documented in the Blue Book.  This means e.g. any(list()) works.

    o	New function encodeString() to encode character strings in the
	same way that printing does.

    o	duplicated() and unique() now accept "list" objects, but are
	fast only for simple list objects.

    o	Hashing has been tweaked to use half as much memory as before.

    o	Readline is not used for tilde expansion when R is run with
	--no-readline, nor from embedded applications.	Then "~name"
	is no longer expanded, but "~" still is.

    o	scan() arranges to share storage of duplicated character
	strings read in: this can dramatically reduce the memory
	requirements for large character vectors which will
	subsequently be turned into factors with relatively few
	levels.	 For a million items this halved the time and reduced
	storage by a factor of 20.

    o	There is a new version for write.table() which is implemented in C.
	For simple matrices and data frames this is several times
	faster than before, and uses negligible memory compared to the
	object size.

	The old version (which no longer coerces a matrix to a data
	frame and then back to a matrix) is available for now as
	write.table0().

    o	New convenience wrappers write.csv() and write.csv2().


UTILITIES

    o	New functions mirror2html() and checkCRAN().

    o	R CMD check has a new option '--use-valgrind'.

	R CMD check now checks that Fortran and C++ files have LF
	line endings, as well as C files.

    o	tools:::.install_package_code_files() (used to collate R files
	when installing packages) ensures files are separated by a
	line feed.

    o	vignette() now returns an object of class "vignette" whose
	print() method opens the corresponding PDF file.  The edit()
	method can be used to open the code of the vignette in an
	editor.

    o	R CMD INSTALL on Unix has a new option '--build' matching
	that on Windows, to package as tarball the installed package.

    o	R CMD INSTALL on Unix can now install binary bundles.

    o	R CMD build now changes src files to LF line endings if necessary.

    o	R CMD build now behaves consistently between source and binary
	builds: in each case it prepares a source directory and then
	either packages that directory as a tarball or calls R CMD
	INSTALL --build on the prepared sources.

	This means that R CMD build --binary now respects
	.Rbuildignore and will rebuild vignettes (unless the option
	--no-vignettes is used).  For the latter, it now installs the
	current sources into a temporary library and uses that version
	of the package/bundle to rebuild the vignettes.

    o	R CMD build now reports empty directories in the source tree.

    o	New function write_PACKAGES in package 'tools' to help with
	preparing local package repositories.  (Contributed by Uwe Ligges.)


DOCUMENTATION

    o	File doc/html/faq.html no longer exists, and doc/manual/R-FAQ.html
	(which has active links to other manuals) is used instead.
	(If makeinfo >= 4.5 is not available, the version on CRAN is
	linked to.)

    o	Manual 'Writing R Extensions' has further details on writing
	new front-ends for R using the new public header files.

    o	There are no longer any restrictions on characters in the
	\name{} field of a .Rd file: in particular _ is supported.


C-LEVEL FACILITIES

    o	There are new public C/C++ header files Rinterface.h and
	R_ext/RStartup.h for use with external GUIs.

    o	Added an onExit() function to graphics devices, to be executed
	upon user break if non-NULL.


DEPRECATED & DEFUNCT

    o	The aqua module for MacOS X has been removed: --with-aqua now
	refers to the unbundled Cocoa GUI.

    o	Capabilities "bzip2", "GNOME, "libz" and "PCRE" are defunct.

    o	The undocumented use of UseMethod() with no argument was
	deprecated in 2.0.1 and is now regarded as an error.

    o	Capability "IEEE754" is deprecated.

    o	The 'CRAN' argument to update.packages(), old.packages(),
	new.packages(), download.packages() and install.packages() is
	deprecated in favour of 'repos', which is the new first
	argument (so this is only relevant for calls with named args).

    o	The S3 methods for getting and setting names of "dist" objects
	have been removed (as they provided names with a different
	length from the "dist" object itself).

    o	Option "repositories" is no longer used and so not set.


INSTALLATION CHANGES

    o	R_XTRA_[CF]FLAGS are now used during the configuration tests,
	and [CF]PICFLAGS if --enable-R-shlib was specified.  This
	ensures that features such as inlining are only used if the
	compilation flags specified support them.  (PR#7257)

    o	Files FAQ, RESOURCES, doc/html/resources.html are no longer in
	the SVN sources but are made by 'make dist'.

    o	The GNOME GUI is unbundled, currently available by Subversion only.

    o	Configuring without having the recommended packages is now an
	error unless --with-recommended-packages=no is used.

    o	Configure tries harder to find a minimal set of FLIBS.	Under
	some circumstances this may remove from R_LD_LIBRARY_PATH
	path elements that ought to have specified in LDFLAGS (but
	were not).

    o	The C code for most of the graphics device drivers and their
	afm files are now in package grDevices.

    o	R is now linked against ncurses/termlib/termcap only if
	readline is specified (the default) and requires it.


PACKAGE INSTALLATION CHANGES

    o	install.packages() and friends now accept a vector of URLs for
	'repos' or 'contriburl' and get the newest available version of
	a package from the first repository on the list in which it is
	found.	The argument 'CRAN' is still accepted, but deprecated.

	install.packages() on Unix can now install from local .tar.gz
	files via repos = NULL.

	install.packages() no longer asks if downloaded packages
	should be deleted: they will be deleted at the end of the
	session anyway (and can be deleted by the user at any time).

    o	New function new.packages() to report uninstalled packages
	available at the requested repositories.  This also reports
	incomplete bundles.

    o	New function available.packages(), similar to CRAN.packages()
	but for use with multiple repositories.  Both now only report
	packages whose R version requirements are met.

    o	update.packages() and old.packages() have a new option
	'checkBuilt' to allow packages installed under earlier
	versions of R to be updated.

    o	remove.packages() can now remove bundles.

    o	The Contains: field of the DESCRIPTION file of package bundles
	is now installed, so later checks can find out if the package
	is complete.

    o	packageStatus() is now built on top of *.packages, and gains a
	'method' argument.


BUG FIXES

    o	Configuring for Tcl/Tk makes use of ${TK_LIB_SPEC} ${TK_LIBS}
	not ${TK_LIB_SPEC} ${TK_XLIBSW}, which is correct for
	recent versions of Tk, but conceivably not for old
	tkConfig.sh files.

    o	detach() was not recomputing the S4 methods for primitives
	correctly.

    o	Methods package now has class "expression" partly fixed in basic
	classes, so S4 classes can extend these (but "expression" is
	pretty broken as a vector class in R).

    o	Collected warnings had messages with unneeded trailing space.

    o	S4 methods for primitive functions must be exported from
	namespaces; this is now done automatically.
	Note that is.primitive() is now in "base", not "methods".

    o	package grid:

	- Fixed bug in grid.text() when "rot" argument has length 0.
	  (reported by Emmanuel Paradis)

    o	str() removed any class from environment objects.

    o	.install_package_vignette_index() created an index even in an
	empty 'doc' directory.

    o	The print() method for factors now escapes characters in the
	levels in the same way as they are printed.

    o	str() no longer interprets control characters in character
	strings and factor levels; also no longer truncates factor
	levels unless they are longer than 'nchar.max'.
	Truncation of such long strings is now indicated ''outside''
	the string.

    o	print.factor(quote=TRUE) was not quoting levels, causing
	ambiguity when the levels contained spaces or quotes.

    o	R CMD check was confused by a trailing / on a package name.

    o	write.table() was writing incorrect column names if the data
	frame contained matrix-like columns.

    o	write.table() was not quoting row names for a 0-column x.

    o	t(x)'s default method now also preserves names(dimnames(x)) for 1D
	arrays 'x'.

    o	r <- a %*% b no longer produces names(dimnames(r)) == c("","")
	unless when a or b has named dimnames.

		CHANGES IN R VERSION 2.0.1 patched



NEW FEATURES

    o	warnings() now looks only in the workspace for `last.warning'
	(suggested by PR#7363).

    o	The search for browsers now starts with firefox, and has mozilla
	ahead of netscape.


PACKAGE INSTALLATION CHANGES

    o	A package DESCRIPTION file which contains a Built field (it
	should not!) is now worked around, with loud warnings.


BUG FIXES

    o	split() was accepting raw and list vectors as input, but
	not populating the output correctly.

	split() now handles vectors with names internally and so is
	almost as fast as on vectors without names (and maybe 100x
	faster than before).

    o	subset() now throws an error if its 'subset' argument is not
	logical whereas it could appear to work and give wrong answers
	with e.g. a numeric 'subset' argument.

    o	sum(), max(), min(), prod(), any() and all() were incorrectly
	using partial matching for their na.rm argument.

    o	kmeans() now ensures that the initial cluster centers it chooses
	are distinct.

    o	text()'s default method could segfault if passed 0-length coordinates.

    o	R CMD INSTALL (Unix) was sometimes leaving a temporary dir
	behind.	 (PR#7230)

    o	read.table() could fail when the row.names were looking like numbers.

    o	seq(length= <n>) now always returns "integer" storage.

    o	labels.lm was broken. (PR#7417)

    o	The hashing used for character vectors in object.size() was
	inefficient for vectors with thousands of identical values not
	sharing the same storage (an unusual case).

    o	data.matrix() now warns if applied to a data frame with
	classed columns.

    o	Plotting histograms where the expression used to deparse to
	multiple lines now gives a sensible default title.  (PR#7421)

    o	The print method for getDLLRegisteredRoutines() was badly
	designed, and failed for all the standard packages' DLLs.

    o	getDLLRegisteredRoutines.character() was broken.

    o	write.table(x, row.names=FALSE) was incorrect for a 0-column x.

    o	write.table() assumed dec = "," if it was not ".".



		CHANGES IN R VERSION 2.0.1


NEW FEATURES

    o	Platform equivalence in library() is tested by a new function
	testPlatformEquivalence() which ignores the 'vendor' field and
	can be customized by cognescenti.

    o	The assignment form of split() allows recycling of vectors
	within the value list. In particular, things like
	    split(x, g) <- lapply(split(x, g), mean)
	now work


DOCUMENTATION

    o	Manual `Writing R Extensions' has new sections on writing
	portable packages and on writing new front-ends for R -- the
	latter will be more comprehensive in R 2.1.0 which has new
	public header files.


DEPRECATED & DEFUNCT

    o	The aqua module in MacOS X is deprecated.

    o	Capabilities "bzip2", "GNOME, "libz" and "PCRE" are deprecated.

    o	The GNOME GUI on Unix-alikes is deprecated as part of R;
	it will be available in another form as from R 2.1.0.

    o	The undocumented use of UseMethod() with no argument is now
	formally deprecated.


INSTALLATION CHANGES

    o	Building on Alpha OSF/1 no longer forces the C flag -std1,
	which appears to be no longer needed.  (PR#7257)

    o	The compiler flag -mieee-fp is no longer used on i386 Linux
	(these days it is only passed to the linker and was only
	invoked for compilation steps).

    o	-D__NO_MATH_INLINES is only used on older ix86 glibc-based
	systems which need it (tested at configure time).  This leads to
	small improvements in speed and accuracy on modern systems.

    o	If makeinfo >= 4.5 is not available, warnings are given that
	some of the HTML manuals will be missing, and the index page
	given by help.start() will link to CRAN versions of those manuals.

    o	Files aclocal.m4 and acinclude.m4 used in maintainer builds
	are not longer included in the distribution.


C-LEVEL FACILITIES

    o	It was not clear in 'Writing R Extensions' that some of the
	entry points in the 'Utilities' section were not declared in
	<R.h> (they were in <R_ext/Applic.h>).	Now all the entry
	points in that section are declared in <R_ext/Utils.h>,
	included by <R.h>.


BUG FIXES

    o	The grid.grab() function in package grid would throw an error
	if there were no viewports pushed (now returns NULL).

    o	model.frame.default() takes row names from the response
	variable if that has suitable names and there is no 'data'
	argument.  (This follows S but was not previously implemented
	in R.)

    o	write.table() was not respecting the 'dec' argument for complex
	numbers.

    o	write.table() printed a mixture of numeric and complex numbers
	as all complex.	 (PR#7260)

    o	R CMD INSTALL failed with versioned installs on packages which
	save images (only).

    o	dlogis() gave NaN not 0 for large negative arguments.

    o	Importing from another namespace was broken for versioned
	installs, incorrectly reporting something like
	"package 'imported_from' does not have a name space".

    o	The GNOME interface under Linux/Unix was broken. (PR#7276)

    o	For the jpeg/png devices under Linux/Unix, under certain rare
	circumstances clipping needed to be cleared before starting a
	new page.  (PR#7270, which has been the case since the devices
	were introduced in 1.1.0.)

    o	First lattice plot (first grid.newpage() call) did not start
	a new page IF there had been a previous traditional graphics
	plot (on the same device).

    o	Using install.packages() to install the same package to more
	than one library gave an incorrect warning message.  (If there
	were two or more such packages it might give an error.)

    o	.packages(all.available=TRUE) returned packages with an invalid
	version field in their DESCRIPTION whereas .find.packages() and
	packageDescription() did not.  Now all do not.

    o	packageDescription() now correctly reports that a package does
	not exist, rather than that its DESCRIPTION file is 'missing
	or broken'.

    o	'make dist' from builddir != sourcedir was copying not linking
	recommended packages to *.tgz.

    o	Slots in prototype objects can inherit from locally defined
	classes (which were not being found correctly before).

    o	Several fixes to the behavior of as() when there are either
	coerce= or replace= methods supplied in a call to
	setIs(). Related fixes to setIs() to handle correctly previous
	methods, if there were any.

    o	splinefun(1[0], 1[0])(1) doesn't segfault anymore (PR#7290).
	spline() and splinefun() now also work with missing values by
	omiting them.

    o	ecdf() was failing on inputs containing NAs. (Part of PR#7292)

    o	tools:::.install_package_description was splitting the Built:
	field across lines on platforms with very long names.

    o	capabilities() was wrong for the Aqua GUI on MacOS X.

    o	Using Rprof() with a non-writable 'file' argument is now a
	non-fatal error and does not abort R.

    o	binom.test() did not deparse its arguments early enough such
	that the reported data were ugly if x was a table.

    o	Systems based on glibc, including those using R's substitute for
	strptime, were handling strptime("2001", "%Y") incorrectly, in
	some cases crashing.  R's substitute code has been corrected
	(but problems may remain if glibc is used).  See the ?strptime
	for what should happen (which is system-specific).

    o	untrace() after trace() failed if package 'methods' was attached.
	(PR#7301)

    o	summary.stepfun() was reporting for n > 6 summaries of the
	knots and levels as the actual values.	Both print() and
	summary() methods called the constant values "step heights",
	although they were not the heights of the steps.

    o	is.na/is.nan() were giving spurious warnings if applied to a
	raw vector.

    o	is.atomic() gave incorrect result (false) for a raw vector.

    o	rank() and order() accepted raw and list inputs, but did not
	give a sensible answer (always 1:n).  Similarly, partial sorts
	of a raw vector were accepted but did nothing.

    o	require() without a version argument tried for an unversioned
	load of a package even though a versioned install was already
	loaded.	 This often led to a message that a required package
	was being loaded when it was not actually being loaded.

    o	str(<S4.object>) made use of attributes() instead of slot(),
	and hence didn't properly print NULL slots.

    o	contrib.url() now handles URLs ending in '/' correctly.

    o	str() removed any class from externalptr objects.

    o	logLik() and hence AIC() failed or gave incorrect answers
	on "lm" fits with na.action = na.exclude (and perhaps other
	na.actions's except na.omit and na.fail).

    o	pmax() and pmin() sometimes used NAs in internal subassignments,
	and sometimes these failed.

    o	Subassigning an expression, e.g. expr[2] <- 1, could leave an
	invalid object and so cause a segfault. (PR#7326)

    o	download/install.packages() would misbehave if there was more
	than one version of a package in a repository.

    o	sort(partial=) silently ignored some other arguments: using
	'decreasing' or 'index.return' or supplying a factor are now
	errors.

    o	The ave() function had trouble if the grouping contained
	unused levels.

    o	read.fwf() got confused by skip > 0 and could infinite loop
	under some circumstances.  (PR#7350)

    o	upgrade(x, ask = FALSE) was broken for a "packageStatus" object.

    o	Class "raw" had been omitted from the list of basic classes in
	the "methods" package and so could not be used in S4 classes.

    o	Function getGroupMembers(), part of the definition of S4
	classes, had been promised for release 2.0, but slipped through.
