		CHANGES IN R VERSION 2.1.0


NEW FEATURES

   o	Faster algorithm in summaryRprof().
	

INSTALLATION CHANGES

   o	-D__NO_MATH_INLINES is only used on older ix86 glibc-based
	systems which need it (tested at configure time).

   o	R_XTRA_[CF]FLAGS are now used during the configuration tests,
	and [CF]PICFLAGS if --enable-R-shlib was specified.  This
	ensures that features such as inlining are only used if the
	compilation flags specified support them.  (PR#7257)



BUG FIXES

   o	Configuring for Tcl/TK makes use of ${TK_LIB_SPEC} ${TK_LIBS}
	not ${TK_LIB_SPEC} ${TK_XLIBSW}, which is correct for
	recent versions of Tk, but conceivably not for old
	tkConfig.sh files.

		CHANGES IN R VERSION 2.0.0 patched


BUG FIXES

    o	model.frame.default() takes row names from the response
	variable if that has suitable names and there is no 'data'
	argument.  (This follows S but was not previously implemented
	in R.)

    o	write.table() was not respecting the 'dec' argument for complex
	numbers.

    o	write.table() printed a mixture of numeric and complex numbers
	as all complex.  (PR#7260)

    o   R CMD INSTALL failed with versioned installs on packages which
	save images (only).

    o   dlogis() gave NaN not 0 for large negative arguments.

    o   Building on Alpha OSF/1 no longer forces the C flag -std1,
	which appears to be no longer needed.  (PR#7257)

    o   Importing from another namespace was broken for versioned
	installs, incorrectly reporting something like 
	"package 'imported_from' does not have a name space".

    o	The compiler flag -mieee-fp is no longer used on i386 Linux
	(these days it is only passed to the linker and was only
	invoked for compilation steps).

    o   The GNOME interface under Linux/Unix was broken. (PR#7276)
