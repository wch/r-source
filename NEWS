		CHANGES IN R VERSION 2.0.0 patched


BUG FIXES

    o	model.frame.default() takes row names from the response
	variable if that has suitable names and there is no 'data'
	argument.  (This follows S but was not previously implemented
	in R.)

    o	write.table() was not respecting the 'dec' argument for complex
	numbers.

    o	write.table() printed a mixture of numeric and complex numbers
	as all complex.  (PR#7260)

    o   R CMD INSTALL failed with versioned installs on packages which
	save images (only).
