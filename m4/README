These files are used by a program called aclocal (part of the GNU
automake package) which uses them to create aclocal.m4 which is in turn
used by autoconf to create the configure script at the the top level in
this distribution.

(Actually, as we need to change a few `standard' macros, we need to
create acinclude.m4 by concatenating all m4 files in this directory
before running aclocal.)

The files are as follows.

  R.m4
	contains R specific macros.  Some of these might be useful for
	other systems as well, but we first need to split this into
	pieces.
	R_BLAS_LIBS is based on the AC_ARG_WITH(fastblas) code from
	Octave, but with tests for Alpha CXML/DXML and IRIX SCSL and
	SGIMATH libraries commented out.
	Some macros do not conform to the Autoconf $PKG_$CATEGORY_$FOO
	naming scheme.  These test for `features' such as GNOME, zlib,
	etc., are named R_$FEATURE, and typically define HAVE_$FEATURE.

  clibs.m4
	versions of the autoconf macros to find the Fortran libraries
	amended to find the C libraries (for comparison with the Fortran
	ones).

  codeset.m4
        is from GNU gettext and checks whether nl_langinfo(CODESET)
        is available in langinfo.h.

  gettext.m4
	a concatenation of all the required files from gettext 0.14.1
	except codeset.m4.

  java.m4
	macros for detecting Java runtime environment or JDK.

  libtool.m4
	is from libtool 1.5.6.
