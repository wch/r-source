These files are used by a program called aclocal (part of the GNU
automake package) which uses them to create aclocal.m4 which is in turn
used by autoconf to create the configure script at the the top level in
this distribution.

(Actually, as we need to change a few `standard' macros, we need to
create acinclude.m4 by concatenating all m4 files in this directory
before running aclocal.)

The files are as follows.

  R.m4
	contains R specific macros.  Some of these might be useful for
	other systems as well, but we first need to split this into
	pieces.
	R_BLAS_LIBS is based on the AC_ARG_WITH(fastblas) code from
	Octave, but with tests for Alpha CXML/DXML commented out.

  am-fixes.m4
  	contains R specific versions of
	    AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE
	    AM_MISSING_PROG
	These are necessary to work around a problem in the current
	release version of automake/aclocal in determining missing_dir
	with zsh (problem with CDPATH and pwd; see the docs in the
	autoconf CVS for more info).  Note that the current (2001-04-27)
	automake CVS has a 2-arg only version of AM_MISSING_PROG.

  gnome-gnorba-check.m4
  gnome-orbit-check.m4
  gnome.m4
  libglade.m4
	are from the GNOME project and used for the GNOME configuration.
	Changes made in gnome.m4:
	* Replace AC_ARG_WITH(gnome) by our version in configure.in
	  because we need want_gnome=no by default and use LIBS and
	  CPPFLAGS rather than LDFLAGS and CFLAGS.
	* In AC_ARG_WITH(gnome-includes), standardize doc strings and
	  use CPPFLAGS rather than CFLAGS.
	* In AC_ARG_WITH(gnome-libs), standardize doc strings and use
	  LIBS rather than LDFLAGS.
	Changes made in libglade.m4:
	* In AC_ARG_WITH(libglade-config), standardize doc strings.

  libtool.m4
	is from the libtool CVS.  We currently include a recent version
	of libtool.m4 because the release version 1.3.3 e.g. refuses to
	link a shared lib against a static one.
