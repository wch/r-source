@section What is R?

R is a system for statistical computation and graphics.  It consists of
a language plus a run-time environment with graphics, a debugger, access
to certain system functions, and the ability to run programs stored in
script files.

The design of R has been heavily influenced by two existing languages:
Becker, Chambers & Wilks' S (@pxref{What is S?}) and Sussman's
@uref{http://www.cs.indiana.edu/scheme-repository/home.html, Scheme}.
Whereas the resulting language is very similar in appearance to S, the
underlying implementation and semantics are derived from Scheme.
@xref{What are the differences between R and S?}, for a discussion of
the differences between R and S.

R was initially written by @email{Ross.Ihaka@@r-project.org, Ross Ihaka}
and @email{Robert.Gentleman@@r-project.org, Robert Gentleman}, who are
Senior Lecturers at the Department of Statistics of the University of
Auckland in Auckland, New Zealand.  In addition, a large group of
individuals has contributed to R by sending code and bug reports.

Since mid-1997 there has been a core group (the ``R Core Team'') who can
modify the R source code CVS archive.  The group currently consists of
Doug Bates, Peter Dalgaard, Robert Gentleman, Kurt Hornik, Ross Ihaka,
Friedrich Leisch, Thomas Lumley, Martin Maechler, Guido Masarotto, Paul
Murrell, Brian Ripley, Duncan Temple Lang, and Luke Tierney.

R has a home page at @uref{http://www.r-project.org/}.  It is free
software distributed under a GNU-style copyleft, and an official part of
the GNU project (``GNU S'').

@node What machines does R run on?, What is the current version of R?, What is R?, R Basics
@section What machines does R run on?

R is being developed for the Unix, Windows and Mac families of operating
systems.

The current version of R will configure and build under a number of
common Unix platforms including i386-freebsd, i386-linux, ppc-linux,
mips-sgi-irix, alpha-linux, alpha-dec-osf4, rs6000-ibm-aix,
hppa-hp-hpux, sparc-linux, and sparc-sun-solaris.

@c and according to @email{jlindsey@@luc.ac.be, Jim Lindsey} also on
@c Mac, Amiga and Atari under m68k-linux.

If you know about other platforms, please drop us a note.

@node What is the current version of R?, How can R be obtained?, What machines does R run on?, R Basics
@section What is the current version of R?
 
The current stable Unix/Windows version is @value{REL-VERSION}, the
unstable one is @value{DEV-VERSION}.  Typically, new features are
introduced in the development versions; updates of stable versions are
for bug fixes mostly.  The version for the Mac is pre-alpha.

@node How can R be obtained?, How can R be installed?, What is the current version of R?, R Basics
@section How can R be obtained?

Sources, binaries and documentation for R can be obtained via CRAN, the
``Comprehensive R Archive Network'' (see @ref{What is CRAN?}).

Sources are also available via anonymous rsync.  Use

@example
rsync -rC rsync.r-project.org::@var{module} R
@end example

@noindent
to create a copy of the source tree specified by @var{module} in the
subdirectory @file{R} of the current directory, where @var{module}
specifies one of the three existing flavors of the R sources, and can be
one of @samp{r-release} (latest released version),
@samp{r-release-patched} (latest released version with patches applied),
and @samp{r-devel} (current development version).  The rsync trees are
created directly from the master CVS archive and are updated hourly.
The @option{-C} option in the rsync command is to cause it to skip the
CVS directories.  Further information on rsync is available at
@uref{http://rsync.samba.org/rsync/}.

@subsection How can R be installed (Unix)

If binaries are available for your platform (see @ref{Are there Unix
binaries for R?}), you can use these, following the instructions that
come with them.

Otherwise, you can compile and install R yourself, which can be done
very easily under a number of common Unix platforms (see @ref{What
machines does R run on?}).  The file @file{INSTALL} that comes with the
R distribution contains instructions.

Note that you need a @FORTRAN{} compiler or @command{f2c} in addition to
a C compiler to build R.  Also, you need Perl version 5 to build the R
object documentations.  (If this is not available on your system, you
can obtain a PDF version of the object reference manual via CRAN.)

In the simplest case, untar the R source code, change to the directory
thus created, and issue the following commands (at the shell prompt):

@example
$ ./configure
$ make
@end example

If these commands execute successfully, the R binary and a shell script
font-end called @file{R} are created and copied to the @file{bin}
directory.  You can copy the script to a place where users can invoke
it, for example to @file{/usr/local/bin}.  In addition, plain text help
pages as well as @HTML{} and La@TeX{} versions of the documentation are
built.

Use @kbd{make dvi} to create dvi versions of the R manuals, such as
@file{refman.dvi} (an R object reference index) and @file{R-exts.dvi},
the ``R Extension Writers Guide'', in the @file{doc/manual}
subdirectory.  These files can be previewed and printed using standard
programs such as @command{xdvi} and @command{dvips}.  You can also use
@kbd{make pdf} to build PDF (Portable Document Format) version of the
manuals, and view these using Acrobat.  Manuals written in the GNU
Texinfo system can also be converted to info files suitable for reading
online with Emacs or stand-alone GNU Info; use @kbd{make info} to create
these versions (note that this requires @command{makeinfo} version 4).

Finally, use @kbd{make check} to find out whether your R system works
correctly.

You can also perform a ``system-wide'' installation using @kbd{make
install}.  By default, this will install to the following directories:

@table @file
@item $@{prefix@}/bin
(some) executables
@item $@{prefix@}/man/man1
man pages
@item $@{prefix@}/lib/R
all the rest (libraries, on-line help system, @dots{}).  This is the ``R
Home Directory'' (@env{R_HOME}) of the installed system.
@end table

@noindent
In the above, @code{prefix} is determined during configuration
(typically @file{/usr/local}) and can be set by running
@command{configure} with the option

@example
$ ./configure --prefix=/where/you/want/R/to/go
@end example

@noindent
(E.g., the R executable will then be installed into
@file{/where/you/want/R/to/go/bin}.)

To install dvi, info and PDF versions of the manuals, use @kbd{make
install-dvi}, @kbd{make install-info} and @kbd{make install-pdf},
respectively.

@node How can R be installed (Windows), How can R be installed (Macintosh), How can R be installed (Unix), How can R be installed?
@subsection How can R be installed (Windows)

The @file{bin/windows/windows-NT} directory of a CRAN site contains the
latest binary distributions of R for 32 bit versions of MS Windows
(i.e., 95, 98 or NT), as well as binary distributions for a large number
of add-on packages from CRAN.  The Windows version of R was created by
Robert Gentleman, and is now being developed and maintained by
@email{Guido.Masarotto@@r-project.org, Guido Masarotto} and
@email{Brian.Ripley@@r-project.org, Brian D. Ripley}.

@c Note that when uncompressing the zip files, the pkunzip program needs to
@c be invoked with the @samp{-D} flag to create subdirectories.  Also, be
@c aware that some decompression programs do not preserve long file names
@c properly.

For most installations the installer @command{rwinst.exe} will be the
easiest tool to use.

See the @uref{http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/R/rw-FAQ.html, R Windows
FAQ} for more details.

@node How can R be installed (Macintosh),  , How can R be installed (Windows), How can R be installed?
@subsection How can R be installed (Macintosh)

The Power Macintosh port is temporarily on hold, and currently no binary
distribution is available.  We hope that this will change soon.

@c The CRAN @file{bin/macos} directory contains @file{R.sea.hqx}, a
@c binhexed self-extracting archive, and installation instructions in
@c @file{README.MACINTOSH}.  Note that the version in it is nowhere near
@c the quality of the current Unix/Windows version.

@node Are there Unix binaries for R?, What documentation exists for R?, How can R be installed?, R Basics

The @file{bin/osf} directory of a CRAN site contains RPMs for alpha
systems running Digital Unix 4.0 by Albrecht Gebhardt.

@c There are also `tar' distributions for NEXTSTEP on the i386 and m68k
@c platforms in @file{bin/nextstep/i386} and @file{bin/nextstep/m68k}.

No other binary distributions have thus far been made publically
available.

@node What documentation exists for R?, Citing R, Are there Unix binaries for R?, R Basics
@section What documentation exists for R?

Online documentation for most of the functions and variables in R
exists, and can be printed on-screen by typing @kbd{help(@var{name})}
(or @kbd{?@var{name}}) at the R prompt, where @var{name} is the name of
the topic help is sought for.  (In the case of unary and binary
operators and control-flow special forms, the name may need to be be
quoted.)

This documentation can also be made available as one reference manual
for on-line reading in @HTML{} and PDF formats, and as hardcopy via
La@TeX{}, see @ref{How can R be installed?}.  An up-to-date @HTML{}
version is always available for web browsing at
@uref{http://stat.ethz.ch/R/manual/}.

The R distribution also comes with the following manuals.

@itemize @bullet
@item ``An Introduction to R'' (@file{R-intro})
includes information on data types, programming elements, statistical
modeling and graphics.  This document is based on the ``Notes on
@SPLUS{}'' by Bill Venables and David Smith.
@item ``Writing R Extensions'' (@file{R-exts})
currently describes the process of creating R add-on packages, writing R
documentation, R's system and foreign language interfaces, and the R
API.
@end itemize

@noindent
Furthermore, the ``R Language Definition'' manual (@file{R-lang}) is
currently being written, and will be available in R version 1.2.
@c FIXME 1.2
This is the ``Kernighan & Ritchie of R'', explaining evaluation,
parsing, object oriented programming, computing on the language, and so
forth.

In addition to material written specifically for R, documentation for
S/@SPLUS{} (see @ref{R and S}) can be used in combination with this FAQ
(@pxref{What are the differences between R and S?}).  We recommend

@noindent
This has a home page at @uref{http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/MASS3/}
providing additional material, in particular ``R Complements'' which
describe how to use the book with R.  These complements provide both
descriptions of some of the differences between R and @SPLUS{}, and the
modifications needed to run the examples in the book.  Its companion
volume on ``S Programming'', due in about April 2000, will provide an
in-depth guide to writing software in the S language which forms the
basis of both the commercial @SPLUS{} and the Open Source R data
analysis software systems.

@section What mailing lists exist for R?

Thanks to @email{Martin.Maechler@@r-project.org, Martin Maechler}, there
are three mailing lists devoted to R.

@table @code
@item r-announce
This list is for announcements about the development of R and the
availability of new code.
@item r-devel
This list is for discussions about the future of R and pre-testing of
new versions.  It is meant for those who maintain an active position in
the development of R.
@item r-help
The `main' R mailing list, for announcements about the development of R
and the availability of new code, questions and answers about problems
and solutions using R, enhancements and patches to the source code and
documentation of R, comparison and compatibility with S and @SPLUS{},
and for the posting of nice examples and benchmarks.
@end table

@noindent
Note that the r-announce list is gatewayed into r-help, so you don't
need to subscribe to both of them.

Send email to @email{r-help@@lists.r-project.org} to reach everyone on
the r-help mailing list.  To subscribe (or unsubscribe) to this list
send @samp{subscribe} (or @samp{unsubscribe}) in the @emph{body} of the
message (not in the subject!) to
@email{r-help-request@@lists.r-project.org}.  Information about the list
can be obtained by sending an email with @samp{info} as its contents to
@email{r-help-request@@lists.r-project.org}.

Subscription and posting to the other lists is done analogously, with
`r-help' replaced by `r-announce' and `r-devel', respectively.

It is recommended that you send mail to r-help rather than only to the R
developers (who are also subscribed to the list, of course).  This may
save them precious time they can use for constantly improving R, and
will typically also result in much quicker feedback for yourself.

Of course, in the case of bug reports it would be very helpful to have
code which reliably reproduces the problem.  Also, make sure that you
include information on the system and version of R being used.  See
@ref{R Bugs} for more details.

Archives of the above three mailing lists are made available on the net
in a monthly schedule via the @file{doc/mail/mail.html} file in CRAN.
An @HTML{} archive of the lists are available via

``Programming with Data''} by John M. Chambers (1998), Springer: New
York, ISBN 0-387-98503-4.

In 1998, the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) presented its
Software System Award to John Chambers for the design of the S system.
The ACM citation stated that ``S has forever altered the way people
analyze, visualize, and manipulate data @dots{}.  S is an elegant,
widely accepted, and enduring software system, with conceptual
integrity, thanks to the insight, taste, and effort of John Chambers.''

@subsection Lexical scoping

Whereas the developers of R have tried to stick to the S language as
defined in ``The New S Language'' (Blue Book, see @ref{What is S?}),
they have adopted the evaluation model of Scheme.

This difference becomes manifest when @emph{free} variables occur in a
function.  Free variables are those which are neither formal parameters
(occurring in the argument list of the function) nor local variables
(created by assigning to them in the body of the function).  Whereas S
(like C) by default uses @emph{static} scoping, R (like Scheme) has
adopted @emph{lexical} scoping.  This means the values of free variables
are determined by a set of global variables in S, but in R by the
bindings that were in effect at the time the function was created.

Consider the following function:

@example
cube <- function(n) @{
  sq <- function() n * n
  n * sq()
@}
@end example

Under S, @code{sq()} does not ``know'' about the variable @code{n}
unless it is defined globally:

@example
S> cube(2)
Error in sq():  Object "n" not found
Dumped
S> n <- 3
S> cube(2)
[1] 18
@end example

In R, the ``environment'' created when @code{cube()} was invoked is
also looked in:

@example
R> cube(2)
[1] 8
@end example

@c The following more `realistic' example illustrating the differences in
@c scoping is due to @email{thomas@@biostat.washington.edu, Thomas Lumley}.
@c The function

@c @example
@c jackknife.lm <- function(lmobj) @{
@c   n <- length(resid(lmobj))
@c   jval <- sapply(1:n, function(i) coef(update(lmobj, subset = -i)))
@c   (n - 1) * (n - 1) * var(jval) / n
@c @}
@c @end example

@c @noindent
@c does something useful in R, but does not work in S.  In order to make it
@c work in S you need to explicitly pass the linear model object into the
@c function nested in @code{apply()}.  If you don't and you are lucky you
@c will get @samp{Error: Object "lmobj" not found}.  If you are unlucky
@c enough to have a linear model called @code{lmobj} in your global
@c environment you will get the wrong answer with no warning.

@c The following version works in S.

@c @example
@c jackknife.S.lm <- function(lmobj) @{
@c   n <- length(resid(lmobj))
@c   jval <- sapply(1:n,
@c                  function(i, lmobj) coef(update(lmobj, subset = -i)), 
@c                  lmobj = lmobj)
@c   (n - 1) * (n - 1) * var(jval) / n
@c @}
@c @end example

@c (The S version was written independently by Thomas and at least three of
@c his fellow students over the past couple of years, causing literally
@c hours of confusion on each occasion.)

As a more ``interesting'' real-world problem, suppose you want to write
a function which returns the density function of the @math{r}-th order
statistic from a sample of size @math{n} from a (continuous)
distribution.  For simplicity, we shall use both the cdf and pdf of the
distribution as explicit arguments.  (Example compiled from various
postings by Luke Tierney.)

The @SPLUS{} documentation for @code{call()} basically suggests the
following:

@example
dorder <- function(n, r, pfun, dfun) @{
  f <- function(x) NULL
  con <- round(exp(lgamma(n + 1) - lgamma(r) - lgamma(n - r + 1)))
  PF <- call(substitute(pfun), as.name("x"))
  DF <- call(substitute(dfun), as.name("x"))
  f[[length(f)]] <-
    call("*", con,
         call("*", call("^", PF, r - 1),
              call("*", call("^", call("-", 1, PF), n - r),
                   DF)))
  f
@}
@end example

@noindent Rather tricky, isn't it?  The code uses the fact that in S,
functions are just lists of special mode with the function body as the
last argument, and hence does not work in R (one could make the idea
work, though).

A version which makes heavy use of @code{substitute()} and seems to work
under both S and R is

@example
dorder <- function(n, r, pfun, dfun) @{
  con <- round(exp(lgamma(n + 1) - lgamma(r) - lgamma(n - r + 1)))
  eval(substitute(function(x) K * PF(x)^a * (1 - PF(x))^b * DF(x),
                  list(PF = substitute(pfun), DF = substitute(dfun),
                       a = r - 1, b = n - r, K = con)))
@}
@end example

@noindent
(the @code{eval()} is not needed in S).

However, in R there is a much easier solution:

@example
dorder <- function(n, r, pfun, dfun) @{
  con <- round(exp(lgamma(n + 1) - lgamma(r) - lgamma(n - r + 1)))
  function(x) @{
    con * pfun(x)^(r - 1) * (1 - pfun(x))^(n - r) * dfun(x)
  @}
@}
@end example

@noindent
This seems to be the ``natural'' implementation, and it works because
the free variables in the returned function can be looked up in the
defining environment (this is lexical scope).

Note that what you really need is the function @emph{closure}, i.e., the
body along with all variable bindings needed for evaluating it.  Since
in the above version, the free variables in the value function are not
modified, you can actually use it in S as well if you abstract out the
closure operation into a function @code{MC()} (for ``make closure''):

@example
dorder <- function(n, r, pfun, dfun) @{
  con <- round(exp(lgamma(n + 1) - lgamma(r) - lgamma(n - r + 1)))
  MC(function(x) @{
       con * pfun(x)^(r - 1) * (1 - pfun(x))^(n - r) * dfun(x)
     @},
     list(con = con, pfun = pfun, dfun = dfun, r = r, n = n))
@}
@end example

Given the appropriate definitions of the closure operator, this works in
both R and S, and is much ``cleaner'' than a substitute/eval solution
(or one which overrules the default scoping rules by using explicit
access to evaluation frames, as is of course possible in both R and S).

For R, @code{MC()} simply is

@example
MC <- function(f, env) f
@end example

@noindent (lexical scope!), a version for S is

@example
MC <- function(f, env = NULL) @{
  env <- as.list(env)
  if (mode(f) != "function")
    stop(paste("not a function:", f))
  if (length(env) > 0 && any(names(env) == ""))
    stop(paste("not all arguments are named:", env))
  fargs <- if(length(f) > 1) f[1:(length(f) - 1)] else NULL
  fargs <- c(fargs, env)
  if (any(duplicated(names(fargs))))
    stop(paste("duplicated arguments:", paste(names(fargs)),
         collapse = ", "))
  fbody <- f[length(f)]
  cf <- c(fargs, fbody)
  mode(cf) <- "function"
  return(cf)
@}
@end example

Similarly, most optimization (or zero-finding) routines need some
arguments to be optimized over and have other parameters that depend on
the data but are fixed with respect to optimization.  With R scoping
rules, this is a trivial problem; simply make up the function with the
required definitions in the same environment and scoping takes care of
it.  With S, one solution is to add an extra parameter to the function
and to the optimizer to pass in these extras, which however can only
work if the optimizer supports this.

Lexical scoping allows using function closures and maintaining local
state.  A simple example (taken from Abelson and Sussman) is obtained by
typing @kbd{demo(scoping)} at the R prompt.  Further information is
provided in the standard R reference ``R: A Language for Data Analysis
and Graphics'' (@pxref{What documentation exists for R?}) and a paper on
``Lexical Scope and Statistical Computing'' by Robert Gentleman and Ross
Ihaka which can be obtained from the @file{doc/misc} directory of a CRAN
site and will appear in the
@uref{http://www.amstat.org/publications/jcgs/, , @emph{Journal of
Computational and Graphical Statistics}} around the beginning of 2000.

@c CHECK JCGS paper ``Lexical Scope and Statistical Computing''

Lexical scoping also implies a further major difference.  Whereas S
stores all objects as separate files in a directory somewhere (usually
@file{.Data} under the current directory), R does not.  All objects
in R are stored internally.  When R is started up it grabs a very large
piece of memory and uses it to store the objects.  R performs its own
memory management of this piece of memory.  Having everything in memory
is necessary because it is not really possible to externally maintain
all relevant ``environments'' of symbol/value pairs.  This difference
also seems to make R @emph{faster} than S.

The down side is that if R crashes you will lose all the work for the
current session.  Saving and restoring the memory ``images'' (the
functions and data stored in R's internal memory at any time) can be a
bit slow, especially if they are big.  In S this does not happen,
because everything is saved in disk files and if you crash nothing is
likely to happen to them.  (In fact, one might conjecture that the S
developers felt that the price of changing their approach to persistent
storage just to accommodate lexical scope was far too expensive.)
Hence, when doing important work, you might consider saving often (see
@ref{How can I save my workspace?}) to safeguard against possible
crashes.  Other possibilities are logging your sessions, or have your R
commands stored in text files which can be read in using
@code{source()}.

@quotation
@strong{Note:}  If you run R from within Emacs (see @ref{R and Emacs}),
you can save the contents of the interaction buffer to a file and
conveniently manipulate it using @code{ess-transcript-mode}, as well as
save source copies of all functions and data used.
@end quotation

@node Models, Others, Lexical scoping, What are the differences between R and S?
@subsection Models

There are some differences in the modeling code, such as

@itemize @bullet
@item
Whereas in S, you would use @code{lm(y ~ x^3)} to regress @code{y} on
@code{x^3}, in R, you have to insulate powers of numeric vectors (using
@code{I()}), i.e., you have to use @code{lm(y ~ I(x^3))}.
@item
The glm family objects are implemented differently in R and S.  The same
functionality is available but the components have different names.
@item
Option @code{na.action} is set to @code{"na.omit"} by default in R,
but not set in S.
@item
Terms objects are stored differently.  In S a terms object is an
expression with attributes, in R it is a formula with attributes.  The
attributes have the same names but are mostly stored differently.  The
major difference in functionality is that a terms object is
subscriptable in S but not in R.  If you can't imagine why this would
matter then you don't need to know.
@item
Finally, in R @code{y~x+0} is an alternative to @code{y~x-1} for
specifying a model with no intercept.  Models with no parameters at all
can be specified by @code{y~0}.
@end itemize

@node Others,  , Models, What are the differences between R and S?
@subsection  Others

Apart from lexical scoping and its implications, R follows the S
language definition in the Blue Book as much as possible, and hence
really is an ``implementation'' of S.  There are some intentional
differences where the behavior of S is considered ``not clean''.  In
general, the rationale is that R should help you detect programming
errors, while at the same time being as compatible as possible with S.

Some known differences are the following.

@itemize @bullet

@item
In R, if @code{x} is a list, then @code{x[i] <- NULL} and @code{x[[i]]
<- NULL} remove the specified elements from @code{x}.  The first of
these is incompatible with S, where it is a no-op.  (Note that you can
set elements to @code{NULL} using @code{x[i] <- list(NULL)}.)

@item
In S, the functions named @code{.First} and @code{.Last} in the
@file{.Data} directory can be used for customizing, as they are executed
at the very beginning and end of a session, respectively.

In R, the startup mechanism is as follows.  R first sources the system
startup file @file{@env{$@w{R_HOME}}/library/base/R/Rprofile}.  Then, it
searches for a site-wide startup profile unless the command line option
@option{--no-site-file} was given.  The name of this file is taken from
the value of the @env{R_PROFILE} environment variable.  If that variable
is unset, the default is @file{@env{$R_HOME}/etc/Rprofile}.  Then,
unless @option{--no-init-file} was given, R searches for a file called
@file{.Rprofile} in the current directory or in the user's home
directory (in that order) and sources it.  It also loads a saved image
from @file{.RData} in case there is one (unless @option{--no-restore}
was specified).  If needed, the functions @code{.First()} and
@code{.Last()} should be defined in the appropriate startup profiles.

@item
In R, @code{T} and @code{F} are just variables being set to @code{TRUE}
and @code{FALSE}, respectively, but are not reserved words as in S and
hence can be overwritten by the user.  (This helps e.g.@: when you have
factors with levels @code{"T"} or @code{"F"}.)  Hence, when writing code
you should always use @code{TRUE} and @code{FALSE}.

@item
In R, @code{dyn.load()} can only load @emph{shared libraries}, as
created for example by @kbd{R SHLIB}.

@item
In R, @code{attach()} currently only works for lists and data frames
(not for directories).  Also, you cannot attach at position 1.

@item
Categories do not exist in R, and never will as they are deprecated now
in S.  Use factors instead.

@item
In R, @code{For()} loops are not necessary and hence not supported.

@item
In R, @code{assign()} uses the argument @option{envir=} rather than
@option{where=} as in S.

@item
The random number generators are different, and the seeds have different
length.

@item
R passes integer objects to C as @code{int *} rather than @code{long *}
as in S.

@item
R has no single precision storage mode.  However, as of version 0.65.1,
there is a single precision interface to C/@FORTRAN{} subroutines.

@item
By default, @code{ls()} returns the names of the objects in the current
(under R) and global (under S) environment, respectively.  For example,
given

@smallexample
x <- 1; fun <- function() @{y <- 1; ls()@}
@end smallexample

@noindent
then @code{fun()} returns @code{"y"} in R and @code{"x"} (together with
the rest of the global environment) in S.

@item
R allows for zero-extent matrices (and arrays, i.e., some elements of
the @code{dim} attribute vector can be 0).  This has been determined a
useful feature as it helps reducing the need for special-case tests for
empty subsets.  For example, if @code{x} is a matrix, @code{x[, FALSE]}
is not @code{NULL} but a ``matrix'' with 0 columns.  Hence, such objects
need to be tested for by checking whether their @code{length()} is zero
(which works in both R and S), and not using @code{is.null()}.

@item
Named vectors are considered vectors in R but not in S (e.g.,
@code{is.vector(c(a = 1:3))} returns @code{FALSE} in S and @code{TRUE}
in R).

@item
Data frames are not considered as matrices in R (i.e., if @code{DF} is a
data frame, then @code{is.matrix(DF)} returns @code{FALSE} in R and
@code{TRUE} in S).

@item
R by default uses treatment contrasts in the unordered case, whereas S
uses the Helmert ones.  This is a deliberate difference reflecting the
opinion that treatment contrasts are more natural.

@item
In R, the last argument (which corresponds to the right hand side) of an
assignment function must be named @samp{value}.  E.g., @code{fun(a) <-
b} is evaluated as @code{(fun<-)(a, value = b)}.

@item
In S, @code{substitute()} searches for names for substitution in the
given expression in three places: the actual and the default arguments
of the matching call, and the local frame (in that order).  R looks in
the local frame only, with the special rule to use a ``promise'' if a
variable is not evaluated.  Since the local frame is initialized with
the actual arguments or the default expressions, this is usually
equivalent to S, until assignment takes place.

@item
In R, @code{eval(EXPR, sys.parent())} does not work.  Instead, one
should use @code{eval(EXPR, sys.frame(sys.parent())),} which also works
in S.

@item
In S, the index variable in a @code{for()} loop is local to the inside
of the loop.  In R it is local to the environment where the @code{for()}
statement is executed.

@item
In S, @code{tapply(simplify=TRUE)} returns a vector where R returns a
one-dimensional array (which can have named dimnames).

@end itemize

There are also differences which are not intentional, and result from
missing or incorrect code in R.  The developers would appreciate hearing
about any deficiencies you may find (in a written report fully
documenting the difference as you see it).  Of course, it would be
useful if you were to implement the change yourself and make sure it
works.

@section Is there anything R can do that @sc{S-Plus} cannot?

Since almost anything you can do in R has source code that you could
port to @SPLUS{} with little effort there will never be much you can do
in R that you couldn't do in @SPLUS{} if you wanted to.  (Note that
using lexical scoping may simplify matters considerably, though.)

R offers several graphics features that @SPLUS{} does not, such as finer
handling of line types, more convenient color handling (via palettes),
gamma correction for color, and, most importantly, mathematical
annotation in plot texts, via input expressions reminiscent of @TeX{}
constructs.  See the help page for @code{plotmath}, which features an
impressive on-line example.  The paper ``An Approach to Providing
Mathematical Annotation in Plots'' by Paul Murrell and Ross Ihaka, which
will soon appear in the @uref{http://www.amstat.org/publications/jcgs/,

(Unix only.)  The add-on packages on CRAN come as gzipped tar files
named @code{@var{pkg}_@var{version}.tar.gz}, which may in fact be
``bundles'' containing more than one package.  Provided that
@command{tar} and @command{gzip} are available on your system, type

@example

@noindent
at the shell prompt to install to the default R directory tree (the
@file{library} subdirectory of @file{R_HOME}).  To install to another
tree (e.g., your private one), use

@example
$ R INSTALL -l @var{lib} /path/to/@var{pkg}_@var{version}.tar.gz
@end example

@noindent
where @var{lib} gives the path to the library tree to install to.

Even more conveniently, you can install and automatically update
packages from within R if you have access to CRAN.  See the help page

You can use several library trees of add-on packages.  The easiest way
to tell R to use these is via the environment variable @env{R_LIBS}
which should be a colon-separated list of directories at which R library
trees are rooted.  You do not have to specify the default tree in
@env{R_LIBS}.  E.g., to use a private tree in @file{$HOME/lib/R} and a
public site-wide tree in @file{/usr/local/lib/R-contrib}, put

@example
R_LIBS="$HOME/lib/R:/usr/local/lib/R-contrib"; export R_LIBS

R is in active development and there is always a risk of bugs creeping
in.  Also, the developers do not have access to all possible machines
capable of running R.  So, simply using it and communicating problems is
certainly of great value.

One place where functionality is still missing is the modeling software
as described in ``Statistical Models in S'' (see @ref{What is S?});
Generalized Additive Models (@strong{gam}) and some of the nonlinear
modeling code are not there yet.

The @uref{http://developer.r-project.org/, R Developer Page} acts as an
intermediate repository for more or less finalized ideas and plans for
the R statistical system.  It contains (pointers to) TODO lists, RFCs,
various other writeups, ideas lists, and CVS miscellania.

Many (more) of the packages available at the Statlib S Repository might
be worth porting to R.

@node Is there Emacs support for R?, Should I run R from within Emacs?, R and Emacs, R and Emacs
@section Is there Emacs support for R?

There is an Emacs package called ESS (``Emacs Speaks Statistics'') which
provides a standard interface between statistical programs and
statistical processes.  It is intended to provide assistance for
interactive statistical programming and data analysis.  Languages
supported include: S dialects (S 3/4, @SPLUS{} 3.x/4.x/5.x, and R),
LispStat dialects (XLispStat, ViSta), SAS, Stata, SPSS dialects (SPSS,
PSPP) and SCA.

ESS grew out of the need for bug fixes and extensions to S-mode 4.8
(which was a GNU Emacs interface to S/@SPLUS{} version 3 only).  The
current set of developers desired support for XEmacs, R, S4, and MS
Windows.  In addition, with new modes being developed for R, Stata, and
SAS, it was felt that a unifying interface and framework for the user
interface would benefit both the user and the developer, by helping both
groups conform to standard Emacs usage.  The end result is an increase
in efficiency for statistical programming and data analysis, over the
usual tools.

R support contains code for editing R source code (syntactic indentation
and highlighting of source code, partial evaluations of code, loading
and error-checking of code, and source code revision maintenance) and
documentation (syntactic indentation and highlighting of source code,
sending Examples to running ESS process, and previewing), interacting
with an inferior R process from within Emacs (command-line editing,
searchable command history, command-line completion of R object and file
names, quick access to object and search lists, transcript recording,
and an interface to the help system), and transcript manipulation
(recording and saving transcript files, manipulating and editing saved
transcripts, and re-evaluating commands from transcript files).

The latest versions of ESS are available from
@uref{http://ess.stat.wisc.edu/pub/ESS/} or
@uref{ftp://ess.stat.wisc.edu/pub/ESS/}, or via CRAN.  The @HTML{}
version of the documentation can be found at
@uref{http://stat.ethz.ch/ESS/}.

ESS comes with detailed installation instructions.

For help with ESS, send email to @email{ESS-help@@stat.ethz.ch}.

Please send bug reports and suggestions on ESS to
@email{ESS-bugs@@stat.math.ethz.ch}.  The easiest way to do this from is
within Emacs by typing @kbd{M-x ess-submit-bug-report} or using the
[ESS] or [iESS] pulldown menus.

@node Should I run R from within Emacs?, Debugging R from within Emacs, Is there Emacs support for R?, R and Emacs
@section Should I run R from within Emacs?

Yes, @emph{definitely}.  Inferior R mode provides a readline/history
mechanism, object name completion, and syntax-based highlighting of the
interaction buffer using Font Lock mode, as well as a very convenient
interface to the R help system.

Of course, it also integrates nicely with the mechanisms for editing R
source using Emacs.  One can write code in one Emacs buffer and send
whole or parts of it for execution to R; this is helpful for both data
analysis and programming.  One can also seamlessly integrate with a
revision control system, in order to maintain a log of changes in your
programs and data, as well as to allow for the retrieval of past
versions of the code.

In addition, it allows you to keep a record of your session, which can
also be used for error recovery through the use of the transcript mode.

To specify command line arguments for the inferior R process, use
@kbd{C-u M-x R} for starting R.  This prompts you for the arguments; in
particular, you can increase the memory size this way (@pxref{Why does R
run out of memory?}).

@node Debugging R from within Emacs,  , Should I run R from within Emacs?, R and Emacs
@section Debugging R from within Emacs

To debug R ``from within Emacs'', there are several possibilities.  To
use the Emacs GUD (Grand Unified Debugger) library with the recommended
debugger GDB, type @kbd{M-x gdb} and give the path to the R
@emph{binary}, typically @file{R.X11}, as argument.  At the gdb prompt,
set @env{R_HOME} and other environment variables as needed (using e.g.@:
@kbd{set env R_HOME /path/to/R/}, but see also below), and start the
binary with the desired arguments (e.g., @kbd{run --vsize=12M}).

If you have ESS, you can do @kbd{C-u M-x R @key{RET} - d @key{SPC} g d b
@key{RET}} to start an inferior R process with arguments @option{-d
gdb}.

A third option is to start an inferior R process via ESS (@kbd{M-x R})
and then start GUD (@kbd{M-x gdb}) giving the R binary (using its full
path name) as the program to debug.  Use the program @command{ps} to
find the process number of the currently running R process then use the
@code{attach} command in gdb to attach it to that process.  One
advantage of this method is that you have separate @code{*R*} and
@code{*gud-gdb*} windows.  Within the @code{*R*} window you have all the
ESS facilities, such as object-name completion, that we know and love.

When using GUD mode for debugging from within Emacs, you may find it
most convenient to use the directory with your code in it as the current
working directory and then make a symbolic link from that directory to
the R binary.  That way @file{.gdbinit} can stay in the directory with
the code and be used to set up the environment and the search paths for
the source, e.g.@: as follows:

@smallexample
set env R_HOME /opt/R
set env R_PAPERSIZE letter
set env R_PRINTCMD lpr
dir /opt/R/src/appl
dir /opt/R/src/main
dir /opt/R/src/nmath

@section Why does R run out of memory?

R (currently) uses a @emph{static} memory model.  This means that when
it starts up, it asks the operating system to reserve a fixed amount of
memory for it.  The size of this chunk cannot be changed subsequently.
Hence, it can happen that not enough memory was allocated, e.g., when
trying to read large data sets into R.

In these cases, you should restart R with more memory available, using
the command line options @option{--nsize} and @option{--vsize}.  To
understand these options, one needs to know that R maintains separate
areas for fixed and variable sized objects.  The first of these is
allocated as an array of ``cons cells'' (Lisp programmers will know what
they are, others may think of them as the building blocks of the
language itself, parse trees, etc.), and the second are thrown on a
``heap''.  The @option{--nsize} option can be used to specify the number
of cons cells which R is to use (the default is 250000), and the
@option{--vsize} option to specify the size of the vector heap in bytes
(the default is @w{6 MB}).  Both options must either be integers or
integers ending with @samp{M}, @samp{K}, or @samp{k} meaning `Mega'
(2^20), (computer) `Kilo' (2^10), or regular `kilo' (1000).

E.g., to read in a table of 5000 observations on 40 numeric variables,
@samp{R --vsize=6M} should do (which currently is the default).

Note that the information on where to find vectors and strings on the
heap is stored using cons cells.  Thus, it may also be necessary to
allocate more space for cons cells in order to perform computations with
very ``large'' variable-size objects.

You can find out the current memory consumption (the proportion of heap
and cons cells used) by typing @kbd{gc()} at the R prompt.  This may
help you in finding out whether to increase @option{--vsize} or
@option{--nsize}.  Note that following @kbd{gcinfo(TRUE)}, automatic
garbage collection always prints memory use statistics.

As of version 0.62.3, R will tell you whether you ran out of cons or
heap memory.

The defaults for @option{--nsize} and @option{--vsize} can be changed by
setting the environment variables @env{R_NSIZE} and @env{R_VSIZE}
respectively, perhaps most conveniently on Unix in the R environment
file (@file{~/.Renviron} by default).

When using @code{read.table()}, the memory requirements are in fact
higher than anticipated, because the file is first read in as one long
string which is then split again.  Use @code{scan()} if possible in
case you run out of memory when reading in a large table.

@node Why does sourcing a correct file fail?, How can I set components of a list to NULL?, Why does R run out of memory?, R Miscellania
@section Why does sourcing a correct file fail?

R sometimes has problems parsing a file which does not end in a newline.
This can happen for example when Emacs is used for editing the file and
@code{next-line-add-newlines} is set to @code{nil}.  To avoid the
problem, either set @code{require-final-newline} to a non-@code{nil}
value in one of your Emacs startup files, or make sure R-mode (@pxref{Is
there Emacs support for R?}) is used for editing R source files (which
locally ensures this setting).

Earlier R versions had a similar problem when reading in data files, but
this should have been taken care of now.

@node How can I set components of a list to NULL?, How can I save my workspace?, Why does sourcing a correct file fail?, R Miscellania
@section How can I set components of a list to NULL?

You can use

@example
x[i] <- list(NULL)
@end example

@noindent
to set component @code{i} of the list @code{x} to @code{NULL}, similarly
for named components.  Do not set @code{x[i]} or @code{x[[i]]} to
@code{NULL}, because this will remove the corresponding component from
the list.

For dropping the row names of a matrix @code{x}, it may be easier to use
@code{rownames(x) <- NULL}, similarly for column names.

@node How can I save my workspace?, How can I clean up my workspace?, How can I set components of a list to NULL?, R Miscellania
@section How can I save my workspace?

@code{save.image()} saves the objects in the user's @code{.GlobalEnv} to
the file @file{.RData} in the R startup directory.  (This is also what
happens after @kbd{q("yes")}.)  Using @code{save.image(@var{file})} one
can save the image under a different name.

@node How can I clean up my workspace?, How can I get eval() and D() to work?, How can I save my workspace?, R Miscellania
@section How can I clean up my workspace?

To remove all objects in the currently active environment (typically
@code{.GlobalEnv}), you can do

@example
rm(list = ls(all = TRUE))
@end example

@noindent
(Without @option{all = TRUE}, only the objects with names not starting
with a @samp{.} are removed.)

@node How can I get eval() and D() to work?, Why do my matrices lose dimensions?, How can I clean up my workspace?, R Miscellania
@section How can I get eval() and D() to work?

Strange things will happen if you use @code{eval(print(x), envir = e)}
or @code{D(x^2, "x")}.  The first one will either tell you that
"@code{x}" is not found, or print the value of the wrong @code{x}.
The other one will likely return zero if @code{x} exists, and an error
otherwise.

This is because in both cases, the first argument is evaluated in the
calling environment first.  The result (which should be an object of
mode @code{"expression"} or @code{"call"}) is then evaluated or
differentiated.  What you (most likely) really want is obtained by
``quoting'' the first argument upon surrounding it with
@code{expression()}.  For example,

@example
R> D(expression(x^2), "x")
2 * x
@end example

Although this behavior may initially seem to be rather strange, is
perfectly logical.  The ``intuitive'' behavior could easily be
implemented, but problems would arise whenever the expression is
contained in a variable, passed as a parameter, or is the result of a
function call.  Consider for instance the semantics in cases like

@example
D2 <- function(e, n) D(D(e, n), n)
@end example

@noindent
or

@example
g <- function(y) eval(substitute(y), sys.frame(sys.parent(n = 2)))
g(a * b)
@end example

See the help page for @code{deriv()} for more examples.

@node Why do my matrices lose dimensions?, How does autoloading work?, How can I get eval() and D() to work?, R Miscellania
@section Why do my matrices lose dimensions?

When a matrix with a single row or column is created by a subscripting
operation, e.g., @code{row <- mat[2, ]}, it is by default turned into a
vector.  In a similar way if an array with dimension, say, @w{2 x 3 x 1
x 4} is created by subscripting it will be coerced into a @w{2 x 3 x 4}
array, losing the unnecessary dimension.  After much discussion this has
been determined to be a @emph{feature}.

To prevent this happening, add the option @option{drop = FALSE} to the
subscripting.  For example,

@example
rowmatrix <- mat[2, , drop = FALSE]  # @r{creates a row matrix}
colmatrix <- mat[, 2, drop = FALSE]  # @r{creates a column matrix}
a <- b[1, 1, 1, drop = FALSE]        # @r{creates a 1 x 1 x 1 array}
@end example

The @option{drop = FALSE} option should be used defensively when
programming.  For example, the statement

@example
somerows <- mat[index, ]
@end example

@noindent
will return a vector rather than a matrix if @code{index} happens to
have length 1, causing errors later in the code.  It should probably be
rewritten as

@example
somerows <- mat[index, , drop = FALSE]
@end example

@node How does autoloading work?, How should I set options?, Why do my matrices lose dimensions?, R Miscellania
@section How does autoloading work?

R has a special environment called @code{.AutoloadEnv}.  Using
@kbd{autoload(@var{name}, @var{pkg})}, where @var{name} and
@var{pkg} are strings giving the names of an object and the package
containing it, stores some information in this environment.  When R
tries to evaluate @var{name}, it loads the corresponding package
@var{pkg} and reevaluates @var{name} in the new package's
environment.

Using this mechanism makes R behave as if the package was loaded, but
does not occupy memory (yet).

See the help page for @code{autoload()} for a very nice example.

@node How should I set options?, How do file names work in Windows?, How does autoloading work?, R Miscellania
@section How should I set options?

The function @code{options()} allows setting and examining a variety of
global ``options'' which affect the way in which R computes and displays
its results.  The variable @code{.Options} holds the current values of
these options, but should never directly be assigned to unless you want
to drive yourself crazy---simply pretend that it is a ``read-only''
variable.

For example, given

@example
test1 <- function(x = pi, dig = 3) @{
  oo <- options(digits = dig); on.exit(options(oo));
  cat(.Options$digits, x, "\n")
@}
test2 <- function(x = pi, dig = 3) @{
  .Options$digits <- dig
  cat(.Options$digits, x, "\n")
@}
@end example

@noindent
we obtain:

@example
R> test1()
3 3.14 
R> test2()
3 3.141593
@end example

What is really used is the @emph{global} value of @code{.Options}, and
using @kbd{options(OPT = VAL)} correctly updates it.  Local copies of
@code{.Options}, either in @code{.GlobalEnv} or in a function
environment (frame), are just silently disregarded.

@node How do file names work in Windows?, Why does plotting give a color allocation error?, How should I set options?, R Miscellania
@section How do file names work in Windows?

As R uses C-style string handling, @samp{\} is treated as an escape
character, so that for example one can enter a newline as @samp{\n}.
When you really need a @samp{\}, you have to escape it with another
@samp{\}.

Thus, in filenames use something like @code{"c:\\data\\money.dat"}.  You
can also replace @samp{\} by @samp{/} (@code{"c:/data/money.dat"}).

@section Why does plotting give a color allocation error?

Sometimes plotting, e.g., when running @code{demo(image)}, results in
``Error: color allocation error''.  This is an X problem, and only
indirectly related to R.  It occurs when applications started prior to R
have used all the available colors.  (How many colors are available
depends on the X configuration; sometimes only 256 colors can be used.)

One application which is notorious for ``eating'' colors is Netscape.
If the problem occurs when Netscape is running, try (re)starting it with
either the @option{-no-install} (to use the default colormap) or the
@option{-install} (to install a private colormap) option.

You could also set the @code{colortype} of @code{X11()} to `pseudo.cube'
rather than the default `pseudo'.  See the help page for @code{X11()}
for more information.

@section Is R Y2K-compliant?

We expect R to be Y2K compliant when compiled and run on a Y2K compliant
system.  In particular R does not internally represent or manipulate
dates as two-digit quantities.  However, no guarantee of Y2K compliance
is provided for R.  R is free software and comes with @emph{no warranty
whatsoever}.

R, like any other programming language, can be used to write programs
and manipulate data in ways that are not Y2K compliant.

@node How do I convert factors to numeric?,  , Is R Y2K-compliant?, R Miscellania
@section How do I convert factors to numeric?

It may happen that when reading numeric data into R (usually, when
reading in a file), they come in as factors.  If @code{f} is such a
factor object, you can use

@example
as.numeric(as.character(f))
@end example

@noindent
to get the numbers back.  More efficient, but harder to remember, is

@example
as.numeric(levels(f))[as.integer(f)]
@end example

In any case, do not call @code{as.numeric} or their likes directly.

@section How should I write summary methods?

Suppose you want to provide a summary method for class @code{foo}.  Then
@code{summary.foo()} should not print anything, but return an object of
class @code{"summary.foo"}, @emph{and} you should write a method
@code{print.summary.foo()} which nicely prints the summary information
and invisibly returns its object.  This approach is preferred over
having @code{summary.foo()} print summary information and return
something useful, as sometimes you need to grab something computed by
@code{summary()} inside a function or similar.  In such cases you don't
want anything printed.

@node How can I debug dynamically loaded code?, How can I inspect R objects when debugging?, How should I write summary methods?, R Programming
@section How can I debug dynamically loaded code?

Roughly speaking, you need to start R inside the debugger, load the
code, send an interrupt, and then set the required breakpoints.

@section What is a bug?

If R executes an illegal instruction, or dies with an operating system
error message that indicates a problem in the program (as opposed to
something like ``disk full''), then it is certainly a bug.  If you call
@code{.C()}, @code{.Fortran()}, @code{.External()} or @code{.Call()} (or
@code{.Internal()}) yourself (or in a function you wrote), you can
always crash R by using wrong argument types (modes).  This is not a
bug.

Taking forever to complete a command can be a bug, but you must make
certain that it was really R's fault.  Some commands simply take a long
time.  If the input was such that you @emph{know} it should have been
processed quickly, report a bug.  If you don't know whether the command
should take a long time, find out by looking in the manual or by asking
for assistance.

If a command you are familiar with causes an R error message in a case
where its usual definition ought to be reasonable, it is probably a bug.
If a command does the wrong thing, that is a bug.  But be sure you know
for certain what it ought to have done.  If you aren't familiar with the
command, or don't know for certain how the command is supposed to work,
then it might actually be working right.  Rather than jumping to
conclusions, show the problem to someone who knows for certain.

Finally, a command's intended definition may not be best for statistical
analysis.  This is a very important sort of problem, but it is also a
matter of judgment.  Also, it is easy to come to such a conclusion out
of ignorance of some of the existing features.  It is probably best not
to complain about such a problem until you have checked the
documentation in the usual ways, feel confident that you understand it,
and know for certain that what you want is not available.  If you are
not sure what the command is supposed to do after a careful reading of
the manual this indicates a bug in the manual.  The manual's job is to
make everything clear.  It is just as important to report documentation
bugs as program bugs.  However, we know that the introductory
documentation is seriously inadequate, so you don't need to report this.

If the online argument list of a function disagrees with the manual, one
of them must be wrong, so report the bug.

@node How to report a bug,  , What is a bug?, R Bugs
@section How to report a bug

When you decide that there is a bug, it is important to report it and to
report it in a way which is useful.  What is most useful is an exact
description of what commands you type, starting with the shell command
to run R, until the problem happens.  Always include the version of R,
machine, and operating system that you are using; type @kbd{version} in
R to print this.

The most important principle in reporting a bug is to report
@emph{facts}, not hypotheses or categorizations.  It is always easier to
report the facts, but people seem to prefer to strain to posit
explanations and report them instead.  If the explanations are based on
guesses about how R is implemented, they will be useless; others will
have to try to figure out what the facts must have been to lead to such
speculations.  Sometimes this is impossible.  But in any case, it is
unnecessary work for the ones trying to fix the problem.

For example, suppose that on a data set which you know to be quite large
the command

@smallexample
R> data.frame(x, y, z, monday, tuesday)
@end smallexample

@noindent
never returns.  Do not report that @code{data.frame()} fails for large
data sets.  Perhaps it fails when a variable name is a day of the week.
If this is so then when others got your report they would try out the
@code{data.frame()} command on a large data set, probably with no day of
the week variable name, and not see any problem.  There is no way in the
world that others could guess that they should try a day of the week
variable name.

Or perhaps the command fails because the last command you used was a
method for @code{"["()} that had a bug causing R's internal data
structures to be corrupted and making the @code{data.frame()} command
fail from then on.  This is why others need to know what other commands
you have typed (or read from your startup file).

It is very useful to try and find simple examples that produce
apparently the same bug, and somewhat useful to find simple examples
that might be expected to produce the bug but actually do not.  If you
want to debug the problem and find exactly what caused it, that is
wonderful.  You should still report the facts as well as any
explanations or solutions.  Please include an example that reproduces
the problem, preferably the simplest one you have found.

Invoking R with the @option{--vanilla} option may help in isolating a
bug.  This ensures that the site profile and saved data files are not
read.

On Unix systems a bug report can be generated using the function
@code{bug.report()}.  This automatically includes the version
information and sends the bug to the correct address.  Alternatively the
bug report can be emailed to @email{r-bugs@@lists.r-project.org} or
submitted to the Web page at @uref{http://bugs.r-project.org/}.

Bug reports on contributed packages should perhaps be sent to the
package maintainer rather than to r-bugs.
