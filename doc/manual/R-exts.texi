@cindex Creating packages

Packages provide a mechanism for loading optional code and attached
documentation as needed.  The @R{} distribution provides several
packages, such as @pkg{eda}, @pkg{mva}, and @pkg{stepfun}.

@cindex Package structure

A package consists of a subdirectory containing the files
@file{DESCRIPTION} and @file{INDEX}, and the subdirectories @file{R},
@file{data}, @file{exec}, @file{inst}, @file{man}, and @file{src} (some
of which can be missing).  Optionally the package can also contain
script files @file{configure} and @file{cleanup} which are executed
before and after installation, @xref{Configure and cleanup}.

The @file{DESCRIPTION} file contains basic information about the package
in the following format:

@quotation
@cartouche
@smallexample
Package: pkgname
Version: 0.5-1
Date: 2000/01/04
Title: My first collection of functions
Author: Friedrich Leisch <F.Leisch@@ci.tuwien.ac.at>.
Depends: R (>= 0.99), nlme
Description: A short (one paragraph) description of what
        the package does and why it may be useful.
License: GPL version 2 or newer
URL: http://www.r-project.org, http://www.another.url
@end smallexample
@end cartouche
@end quotation

@noindent
Continuation lines (for example, for descriptions longer than one line)
start with a space or tab.  The @samp{Package}, @samp{Version},
@samp{Author}, and @samp{Description} fields are mandatory, the
remaining fields (@samp{Date}, @samp{Depends}, @samp{Address},
@samp{URL}, @dots{}) are optional.  The @samp{Author} field should
contain an email address in angle brackets (for sending bug reports
etc.).

The @samp{License} field should contain an explicit statement or a
well-known abbreviation (such as @samp{GPL}, @samp{LGPL}, @samp{BSD}, or
@samp{Artistic}), perhaps followed by a reference to the actual license
file.  It is very important that you include this information!
Otherwise, it may not even be legally correct for others to distribute
copies of the package.

The @samp{Title} field should give a short description of the package
and not have any continuation lines.  This information has been
contained in a separate @file{TITLE} file in older versions of @R{},
please use the title field in the @file{DESCRIPTION} file from now on.

The optional @samp{URL} field may give a list of URL's separated by
commas or whitespace, for example the homepage of the author or a page
where additional material describing the software can be found.  These
URLs are converted to active hyperlinks on CRAN.

The optional @samp{Depends} field gives a comma-separated list of
package names which this package depends on.  The package name may be
optionally followed by comparison operator (currently only @samp{>=} and
@samp{<=} are supported) and a version number in parentheses.  You can
also use the special package name @samp{R} if your package depends on a
certain version of R.  E.g, if the package works only with R version
0.90 or newer, include @samp{R (>= 0.90)} in the @samp{Depends} field.
Future versions of R will use this field to autoload required packages,
hence please do not misuse the @samp{Depends} field for comments on
other software that might be needed or not using proper syntax.  Other
dependencies should be listed in the @samp{Description} field or a
separate @samp{README} file.  The @samp{R INSTALL} facility already
checks if the running version of R is good enough for a package.

@node Other files, Package subdirectories, The DESCRIPTION file, Package structure
@subsection Other files
@comment  node-name,  next,  previous,  up

The file @file{INDEX} contains a line for each sufficiently interesting
object in the package, giving its name and a description (functions such
as print methods not usually called explicitly might not be included).
Note that you can automatically create this file using something like
@code{R CMD Rdindex man/*.Rd > INDEX}, provided that Perl is available
on your system.

@node Package subdirectories, Package bundles, Other files, Package structure
@subsection Package subdirectories
@cindex Package subdirectories

The @file{R} subdirectory contains @R{} code files.  The code files to
be installed must start with a (lower or upper case) letter and have one
of the extensions @file{.R}, @file{.S}, @file{.q}, @file{.r}, or
@file{.s}.  We recommend using @file{.R}, as this extension seems to be
not used by any other software.  It should be possible to read in the
files using @code{source()}, so R objects must be created by
assignments.  Note that there need be no connection between the name of
the file and the R objects created by it.  If necessary, one of these
files (historically @file{zzz.R}) should use @code{library.dynam()}
@emph{inside} @code{.First.lib()} to load compiled code.

The @file{man} subdirectory should contain documentation files for the
objects in the package in ``R documentation'' (Rd) format.  The
documentation files to be installed must also start with a (lower or
upper case) letter and have the extension @file{.Rd} (the default) or
@file{.rd}.  @xref{Writing R documentation}, for more information.

The @file{R} and @file{man} subdirectories may contain OS-specific
subdirectories named @code{unix}, @code{windows} or @code{mac}.

The C or FORTRAN source files for the compiled code, and optionally
files @file{Makevars} and @file{Makefile}, are in @file{src}.  When a
package is installed using @code{R CMD INSTALL}, Make is used to control
compilation and linking into a shared library for loading into @R{}.
There are default variables and rules for this (determined when @R{} is
configured and recorded in @file{$R_HOME/etc/Makeconf}).  If a package
needs to specify additional directories for searching header files
(@samp{-I} options) or additional libraries for linking (@samp{-l} and
@samp{-L} options), it should do this by setting the variables
@code{PKG_CPPFLAGS} and @code{PKG_LIBS} in @file{src/Makevars}.
(Additional flags to be passed to the C or Fortran compiler can be
specified by the variables @code{PKG_CFLAGS} and @code{PKG_FFLAGS},
respectively.)  Note that this mechanism should be general enough to
eliminate the need for a package-specific @file{Makefile}.  If such a
file is to be distributed, considerable care is needed to make it
general enough to work on all @R{} platforms.

The @file{data} subdirectory is for additional data files the package
makes available for loading using @code{data()}.  Currently, data files
can have one of three types as indicated by their extension: plain R
code (@file{.R} or @file{.r}), tables (@file{.tab}, @file{.txt}, or
@file{.csv}), or @code{save()} images (@file{.RData} or @file{.rda}).
The subdirectory should contain a @file{00Index} file that describes the
datasets available.

The contents of the @file{inst} subdirectory will be copied recursively
to the installation directory.

Finally, @file{exec} could contain additional executables the package
needs, typically shell or Perl scripts.  This mechanism is currently not
used by any Unix package, and still experimental.

@node  Package bundles,  , Package subdirectories, Package structure
@subsection Package bundles
@cindex Package bundles

Sometimes it is convenient to distribute several packages as a
@emph{bundle}.  (The main current example is @pkg{VR} which contains
four packages.)  The installation scripts on both Unix and Windows can
handle package bundles as from @R{} 0.90.1.

The @file{DESCRIPTION} file of a bundle has an extra @samp{Bundle}
field, as in

@quotation
@cartouche
@smallexample

Version: 6.1-6

@end smallexample
@end cartouche
@end quotation

The @samp{Contains} field lists the packages, which should be contained
in separate subdirectories with the names given.  These are standard
packages in all respects except that the @file{DESCRIPTION} file is
replaced by a @file{DESCRIPTION.in} file which just contains fields
additional to the @file{DESCRIPTION} file of the bundle, for example

@node Configure and cleanup, Checking and building packages, Package structure, Creating R packages
@comment  node-name,  next,  previous,  up
@section Configure and cleanup

If your package needs some system-dependent configuration before
installation you can include a script @file{configure} in your package
which (if present) is executed by @code{R CMD INSTALL} before any other
action is performed.  This can be a script created by the
@code{autoconf} mechanism, but may also be a script written by yourself.
Use this to detect if any nonstandard libraries are present such that
corresponding code in the package can be disabled at install time rather
than giving error messages when the package is compiled or used.  To
summarize, the full power of @code{autoconf} is available for your
extension package (including variable substitution, searching for
libraries, etc.).

The script @file{cleanup} is executed as last thing by @code{R CMD
INSTALL} if present and can be used to clean up the package source tree,
especially remove files created by @file{configure}.

As an example consider we want to use functionality provided by a (C or
Fortran) library @code{foo}.  Using @code{autoconf}, we can write a
configure script which checks for the library, sets variable
@code{HAVE_FOO} to @code{TRUE} if it was found and with @code{FALSE}
otherwise, and then substitutes this value into output files (by
replacing instances of @samp{@@HAVE_FOO@@} in input files with the value
of @code{HAVE_FOO}).  for example, if a function named @code{bar} is to
be made available by linking against library @code{foo} (i.e., using
@option{-lfoo}), one could use

@smallexample
AC_CHECK_LIB(foo, @var{fun}, HAVE_FOO=TRUE, HAVE_FOO=FALSE)
AC_SUBST(HAVE_FOO)
...
AC_OUTPUT(foo.R)
@end smallexample

The definition of the respective R function in @file{foo.R.in} could be

@smallexample
foo <- function(x) @{
    if(!@@HAVE_FOO@@) stop("Sorry, library `foo' is not available")
    ...
@end smallexample

@noindent
From this file @code{configure} creates the actual R source file
@file{foo.R} looking like

@smallexample
foo <- function(x) @{
    if(!FALSE) stop("Sorry, library `foo' is not available")
    ...
@end smallexample

@noindent
if library @code{foo} was not found (with the desired functionality).
In this case, the above @R{} code effectively disables the function.

One could also use different file fragments for available and missing
functionality, respectively.

You may wish to bear in mind that the @file{configure} script may well
not work on Windows systems (this seems normally to be the case for
those generated by @code{autoconf}, although simple shell scripts do
work).  If your package is to be made publicly available, please give
enough information for a user on a non-Unix platform to configure it
manually.

@node Checking and building packages,  , Configure and cleanup, Creating R packages
@section Checking and building packages
@cindex Building packages
@cindex Checking packages

@findex R CMD check
Using @code{R CMD check}, the @R{} package checker, one can test whether
@emph{installed} @R{} packages work correctly.  Currently, the only
check performed is whether the examples provided by the packages'
documentation can be run successfully (@pxref{Writing R documentation},
for information on using @code{\examples} to create executable example
code.)  Other means for regression testing will be added in the future.

Of course, released packages should be able to run at least their own
examples.

Use @kbd{R CMD check --help} to obtain more information about the usage
of the @R{} package checker.  Under Windows the equivalent command is
@kbd{make pkgcheck-mypkg}.  Note that some packages will require more
than the default workspace size to run their examples: this needs to be
specified by setting the environment variables @code{R_NSIZE} and
@code{R_VSIZE} or (Unix) the command-line options @code{--nsize} and
@code{--vsize}.

@findex R CMD build
@cindex Package builder
Using @code{R CMD build}, the @R{} package builder, one can build R
packages from their sources (for example, for subsequent release).
Prior to actually building the package in the common gzipped tar file
format, a variety of diagnostic checks and cleanups are performed.  In
particular, it is tested whether the @file{DESCRIPTION} file contains
the required entries, whether object and data indices exist and can be
assumed to be up-to-date, whether the documentation sources contain the
required name, alias, title, description, and keyword information, and
whether there are any undocumented user level objects.  Run-time checks
whether the package works correctly should be performed using @code{R
CMD check} prior to invoking the build procedure.

Use @kbd{R CMD build --help} to obtain more information about the usage
of the @R{} package builder.  There is no Windows equivalent.

@section Rd format

@R{} objects are documented in files written in ``@R{} documentation''
(Rd) format, a simple markup language closely resembling (La)@TeX{},
which can be processed into a variety of formats, including La@TeX{},
@HTML{} and plain text.  The translation is carried out by the Perl
script @code{Rdconv} in @file{$R_HOME/bin} and by the installation
scripts for packages.

The @R{} distribution contains more than 600 such files which can be
found in the @file{src/library/@var{pkg}/man} directories of the @R{}
source tree, where @var{pkg} stands for package @pkg{base} where all the
standard objects are, and for the standard packages such as @pkg{eda}
and @pkg{mva} which are included in the @R{} distribution.

As an example, let us look at the file
@file{src/library/base/man/rle.Rd} which documents the @R{} function
@code{rle}.

An Rd file consists of three parts.  The header gives basic information
about the name of the file, the topics documented, a title, a short
textual description and @R{} usage information for the objects
documented.  The body gives further information (for example, on the
function's arguments and return value, as in the above example).
Finally, there is a footer with keyword information.  The header and
footer are mandatory.

See @uref{http://developer.r-project.org/Rds.html, ``Guidelines for Rd
files''} for guidelines for writing documentation in Rd format which
should be useful for package writers.

@subsection Documenting functions

The basic markup commands used for documenting @R{} objects (in
particular, functions) are given in this subsection.

@table @code
@item \name@{@var{file}@}
@findex \name
@var{file} is the basename of the file.

@item \alias@{@var{topic}@}
@findex \alias
The @code{\alias} entries specify all ``topics'' the file documents.
This information (together with the file name) is collected into index
data bases for lookup by the on-line (plain text and @HTML{}) help
systems.

There may be several @code{\alias} entries.  Quite often it is
convenient to document several @R{} objects in one file.  For example,
file @file{Normal.Rd} documents the density, distribution function,
quantile function and generation of random variates for the normal
distribution, and hence starts with

@smallexample
\name@{Normal@}
\alias@{dnorm@}
\alias@{pnorm@}
\alias@{qnorm@}
\alias@{rnorm@}
@end smallexample

Note that the name of the file is not necessarily a topic documented.

@item \title@{@var{Title}@}
@findex \title
Title information for the Rd file.  This should be capitalized, not end
in a period, and not use any markup (which would cause problems for
hypertext search).

@item \description@{@dots{}@}
@findex \description
A short description of what the function(s) do(es) (one paragraph, a few
lines only).  (If a description is ``too long'' and cannot easily be
shortened, the file probably tries to document too much at once.)

@item \usage@{@var{fun}(@var{arg1}, @var{arg2}, @dots{})@}
@findex \usage
One or more lines showing the synopsis of the function(s) and variables
documented in the file.  These are set verbatim in typewriter font.

The usage information specified should in general match the function
definition @emph{exactly} (such that automatic checking for consistency
between code and documentation is possible).  Otherwise, include a
@code{\synopsis}
@findex \synopsis
section with the actual definition.

For example, @code{abline} is a function for adding a straight line to a
plot which can be used in several different ways, depending on the named
arguments specified.  Hence, @file{abline.Rd} contains

@smallexample
\synopsis@{
abline(a = NULL, b = NULL, h = NULL, v = NULL, reg = NULL,
       coef = NULL, untf = FALSE, col = par("col"),
       lty = par("lty"), lwd = NULL, ...)
@}
\usage@{
abline(a, b, \dots)
abline(h=, \dots)
abline(v=, \dots)
@r{@dots{}}
@}
@end smallexample

@item \arguments@{@dots{}@}
@findex \arguments
Description of the function's arguments, using an entry of the form

@smallexample
\item@{@var{arg_i}@}@{@var{Description of arg_i}.@}
@end smallexample

@noindent
for each element of the argument list.  There may be optional text
before and after these entries.

@item \details@{@dots{}@}
@findex \details
A detailed if possible precise description of the functionality
provided, extending the basic information in the @code{\description}
slot.

@item \value@{@dots{}@}
@findex \value
Description of the function's return value.

If a list with multiple values is returned, you can use entries of the
form

@smallexample
\item@{@var{comp_i}@}@{@var{Description of comp_i}.@}
@end smallexample

@noindent
for each component of the list returned.  Optional text may precede this
list (see the introductory example for @code{rle}).

@item \references@{@dots{}@}
@findex \references
A section with references to the literature.  Use @code{\url@{@}} for
web pointers.

@item \note@{...@}
@findex \note
Use this for a special note you want to have pointed out.

For example, @file{piechart.Rd} contains

@smallexample
\note@{
  Pie charts are a very bad way of displaying information.
  The eye is good at judging linear measures and bad at
  judging relative areas.
  ...
@}
@end smallexample

@item \author@{@dots{}@}
@findex \author
Information about the author(s) of the Rd file.  Use @code{\email@{@}}
without extra delimiters (@samp{( )} or @samp{< >}) to specify email
addresses, or @code{\url@{@}} for web pointers.

@item \seealso@{@dots{}@}
@findex \seealso
Pointers to related @R{} objects, using @code{\code@{\link@{...@}@}} to
refer to them (@code{\code} is the correct markup for @R{} object names,
and @code{\link} produces hyperlinks in output formats which support
this.  @xref{Marking text}, and @ref{Cross-references}).

@findex \examples
@item \examples@{@dots{}@}
Examples of how to use the function.  These are set verbatim in
typewriter font.

Examples are not only useful for documentation purposes, but also
provide test code used for diagnostic checking of @R{}.  By default,
text inside @code{\examples@{@}} will be displayed in the output of the
help page and run by @kbd{make check}.  You can use @code{\dontrun@{@}}
@findex \dontrun
for commands that should only be shown, but not run, and
@code{\testonly@{@}}
@findex \testonly
for extra commands for testing @R{} that should not be shown to users.

For example,

@example
x <- runif(10)       # @r{Shown and run.}
\dontrun@{plot(x)@}    # @r{Only shown.}
\testonly@{log(x@}     # @r{Only run.}
@end example

Thus, example code not included in @code{\dontrun} must be executable!
In addition, it should not use any system-specific features or require
special facilities (such as Internet access or write permission to
specific directories).

Data needed for making the examples executable can be obtained by random
number generation (for example, @code{x <- rnorm(100)}), or by using
standard data sets loadable via @code{data()} (see @code{data()} for
info).

@item \keyword@{@var{key}@}
Each @code{\keyword} entry should specify one of the standard keywords
(as listed in thefile @file{$R_HOME/doc/KEYWORDS}).  There must be at
least one @code{\keyword} entry, but can be more that one if the @R{}
object being documented falls into more than one category.
@end table

@findex prompt
The @R{} function @code{prompt} facilitates the construction of files
documenting @R{} objects.  If @code{foo} is an @R{} function, then
@code{prompt(foo)} produces file @file{prompt.Rd} which already contains
the proper function and argument names of @code{foo}, and a structure
which can be filled in with information.

@subsection Documenting datasets

The structure of Rd files which document @R{} data sets is slightly
different.  Whereas sections such as @code{\arguments} and @code{\value}
are not needed, the format and source of the data should be explained.

As an example, let us look at @file{src/library/base/man/rivers.Rd}
which documents the standard @R{} data set @code{rivers}.

@quotation
@cartouche
@smallexample
\name@{rivers@}
\alias@{rivers@}
\title@{Lengths of Major North American Rivers@}
\description@{
  This data set gives the lengths (in miles) of 141 ``major''
  rivers in North America, as compiled by the US Geological
  Survey.
@}
\usage@{data(rivers)@}
\format@{A vector containing 141 observations.@}
\source@{World Almanac and Book of Facts, 1975, page 406.@}
\references@{
  McNeil, D. R. (1977) \emph@{Interactive Data Analysis@}.
  New York: Wiley.
@}
\keyword@{datasets@}
@end smallexample
@end cartouche
@end quotation

This uses the following additional markup commands.

@table @code
@c @item \non_function@{@}
@c Indicates that this is a dataset (for future use).

@item \format@{@dots{}@}
@findex \format
A description of the format of the dataset (as a vector, matrix, data
frame, time series, @dots{}).  For matrices and data frames this should
give a description of each column, preferably as a list or table.
@xref{Lists and tables}, for more information.

@item \source@{@dots{}@}
@findex \source
Details of the original source (a reference or URL).  In addition,
section @code{\references} could give secondary sources and usages.
@end table

Note also that when documenting data set @var{bar},

@itemize @bullet
@item
The @code{\usage} entry always is @code{data(@var{bar})}.
@item
The @code{\keyword} entry always is @code{datasets}.
@end itemize

If @code{bar} is a data frame, documenting it as a data set can again be
initiated via @code{prompt(bar)}.

@node Sectioning, Marking text, Rd format, Writing R documentation
@section Sectioning

To begin a new paragraph or leave a blank line in an example, just
insert an empty line (as in (La)@TeX{}).  To break a line, use
@code{\cr}.

In addition to the predefined sections (such as @code{\description@{@}},
@code{\value@{@}}, etc.), you can ``define'' arbitrary ones by
@code{\section@{@var{section_title}@}@{@dots{}@}}.
@findex \section
For example

@display
@code{\section@{Warning@}@{You must not call this function unless @dots{}@}}
@end display

@noindent
For consistency with the pre-assigned sections, the section name (the
first argument to @code{\section}) should be capitalized (but not all
upper case).

Note that the additonal named sections are always inserted at fixed
positions in the output (before @code{\note}, @code{\seealso} and the
examples), no matter where they appear in the input.

@node Marking text, Lists and tables, Sectioning, Writing R documentation
@section Marking text
@cindex Marking text in documentation

@findex \itemize
@findex \enumerate
The @code{\itemize} and @code{\enumerate} commands take a single
argument, within which there may be one or more @code{\item} commands.
The text following each @code{\item} is formatted as one or more
paragraphs, suitably indented and with the first paragraph marked with a
bullet point (@code{\itemize}) or a number (@code{\enumerate}).

@code{\itemize} and @code{\enumerate} commands may be nested.

@findex \describe
The @code{\describe} command is similar to @code{\itemize} but allows
initial labels to be specified.  The @code{\item}s take two arguments,
the label and the body of the item, in exactly the same way as argument
and value @code{\item}s.  @code{\describe} commands are mapped to
@code{<DL>} lists in @HTML{} and @code{\description} lists in La@TeX{}.

@findex \tabular
The @code{\tabular} command takes two arguments.  The first gives for
each of the columns the required alignment (@code{l} for
left-justification, @code{r} for right-justification or @code{c} for
centring.)  The second argument consists of an arbitrary number of lines
separated by @code{\cr}, and with fields separated by @code{\tab}.  For
example:

@example
  \tabular@{rlll@}@{
    [,1] \tab Ozone   \tab numeric \tab Ozone (ppb)\cr
    [,2] \tab Solar.R \tab numeric \tab Solar R (lang)\cr

    [,6] \tab Day     \tab numeric \tab Day of month (1--31)

There must be the same number of fields on each line as there are
alignments in the first argument, and they must be non-empty (but can
contain only spaces).

@findex \eqn

Mathematical formulae should be set beautifully for printed
documentation yet we still want something useful for text and @HTML{}
online help.  To this end, the two commands
@code{\eqn@{@var{latex}@}@{@var{ascii}@}} and
@code{\deqn@{@var{latex}@}@{@var{ascii}@}} are used.  Where @code{\eqn}
is used for ``inline'' formula (corresponding to @TeX{}'s
@code{$@dots{}$}, @code{\deqn} gives ``displayed equations'' (as in
La@TeX{}'s @code{displaymath} environment, or @TeX{}'s
@code{$$@dots{}$$}).

Both commands can also be used as @code{\eqn@{@var{latexascii}@}} (only
@emph{one} argument) which then is used for both @var{latex} and
@var{ascii}.

The following example is from the @code{Poisson} help page:

@example
\deqn@{p(x) = @{\lambda^x\ \frac@{e^@{-\lambda@}@}@{x!@}@}
     @{p(x) = lambda^x exp(-lambda)/x!@}
for \eqn@{x = 0, 1, 2, ...@}.

$$ p(x) = \lambda^x\ {e^{-\lambda} \over x!} $$
for $x = 0, 1, 2, \ldots$.

For the @HTML{} and the ``direct'' (man-like) on-line help we get

After a @samp{%}, you can put your own comments regarding the help text.
The rest of the line will be completely disregarded, normally.
Therefore, you can also use it to make part of the ``help'' invisible.

You can produce a backslash (@samp{\} by escaping it by another
backslash.  (Note that @code{\cr} is used for generating line breaks.)

The ``comment'' and ``control'' characters @samp{%} and @samp{\}

true.  Unpaired braces will give problems and should be escaped.  See

In ``regular'' text (no verbatim, no @code{\eqn}, @dots{}), you
currently must escape most La@TeX{} special characters, i.e., besides
@samp{%}, @samp{@{}, and @samp{@}}, the four specials @samp{$},
@samp{#}, and @samp{_} are produced by preceding each with a @samp{\}.

If the differences between platforms are extensive or the @R{} objects
documented are only relevant to one platform, platform-specific Rd files
can be put in a @file{unix}, @file{windows} or @file{mac} subdirectory.

@node Processing Rd format,  , Platform-specific sections, Writing R documentation
@section Processing Rd format
@cindex Processing Rd format

Under UNIX versions of @R{} there are several commands to process Rd
files.

@findex R CMD Rdconv
Using @code{R CMD Rdconv} one can convert @R{} documentation format to
other formats, or extract the executable examples for run-time testing.
Currently, conversions to plain text, HTML, La@TeX{}, and @Sl{}
documentation formats are supported.

In addition to this low-level conversion tool, the @R{} distribution
provides two user-level programs for processing Rd format.
@findex R CMD Rd2txt
@findex R CMD Rd2dvi
@code{R CMD Rd2txt} produces ``pretty'' plain text output from an Rd
file, and is particularly useful as a previewer when writing Rd format
documentation within Emacs.  @code{R CMD Rd2dvi} generates DVI (or, if
option @option{--pdf} is given, PDF) output from from documentation in
Rd files, which can be specified either explictly or by the path to a
directory with the sources of a package.  In the latter case, a
reference manual for all documented objects in the package is created.
Future versions will also add the information in the @file{DESCRIPTION}
files to the output.

@findex R CMD Rdindex
Using @code{R CMD Rdindex} one can produce nicely formatted index files
displaying names and titles of the Rd files specified as arguments.
This can be used to create the @file{INDEX} of an add-on package and, if
it also contains data, the @file{00Index} data index in the @file{data}
directory.  Note that the R package builder @code{R CMD build} can be
used to automatically create these indices when building a package.

@findex R CMD Sd2Rd
Finally, @code{R CMD Sd2Rd} converts @Sl{} version 3 documentation files
(which use an extended Nroff format) to Rd format.  This is useful when
porting a package orginally written for the @Sl{} system to @R{}.

The exact usage and a detailed list of available options for each of the
above commands can be obtained by running @code{R CMD command --help},
e.g., @code{R CMD Rdconv --help}.  All available commands can be listed
using @code{R --help}.

@section  Operating system access
@cindex Operating system access

Access to operating system functions is via the @R{} function
@code{system}.
@findex system
The details will differ by platform (see the on-line help), and about
all that can safely be assumed is that the first argument will be a
string @code{command} that will be passed for execution (not necessarily
by a shell) and the second argument will be @code{internal} which if
true will collect the output of the command into an @R{} character
vector.

The function @code{system.time}
@findex system.time
is available for timing (although the information available may be
limited on non-Unix-like platforms).

@node Interface functions .C and .Fortran, dyn.load and dyn.unload, Operating system access, System and foreign language interfaces
@section Interface functions @code{.C} and @code{.Fortran}
@cindex Interfaces to compiled code

@findex .C
@findex .Fortran

These two functions provide a standard interface to compiled code that
has been linked into @R{}, either at build time or via @code{dyn.load}
(@pxref{dyn.load and dyn.unload}).  They are primarily intended for
compiled C and Fortran code respectively, but the @code{.C} function can
be used with other languages which can generate C interfaces, for
example C++ (@pxref{Interfacing C++ code}).

The first argument to each function is a character string given the
symbol name as known to C or Fortran, that is the function or subroutine
name.  (The mapping to the symbol name in the load table is given by the
functions @code{symbol.C} and @code{symbol.For};
@findex symbol.C
@findex symbol.For
that the symbol is loaded can be tested by, for example,
@code{is.loaded(symbol.C("loglin"))}.)

There can be up to 65 further arguments giving @R{} objects to be passed
to compiled code.  Normally these are copied before being passed in, and
copied again to an @R{} list object when the compiled code returns.  If
the arguments are given names, these are used as names for the
components in the returned list object (but not passed to the compiled
code).

The following table gives the mapping between the modes of @R{} vectors
and the types of arguments to a C function or Fortran subroutine.

@quotation
@multitable {RRR storage.mode} {RRR storage.mode} {DOUBLE PRECISION}

@item @R{} storage mode @tab  C type  @tab   Fortran type

@item @code{logical}   @tab @code{int *}     @tab @code{INTEGER}
@item @code{integer}   @tab @code{int *}     @tab @code{INTEGER}
@item @code{double}    @tab @code{double *}  @tab @code{DOUBLE PRECISION}
@item @code{complex}   @tab @code{Rcomplex *} @tab @code{DOUBLE COMPLEX}
@item @code{character} @tab @code{char **}   @tab @code{CHARACTER*255}

@end multitable
@end quotation

C type @code{Rcomplex} is a structure with @code{double} members
@code{r} and @code{i} defined in the header file @file{Complex.h}
included by @file{R.h}.  Only a single character string can be passed to
or from Fortran, and the success of this is compiler-dependent.  Other
@R{} objects can be passed to @code{.C}, but it is better to use one of
the other interfaces.  An exception is passing an @R{} function for use
with @w{@code{call_R}}, when the object can be handled as @code{void *}
en route to @code{call_R}, but even there @code{.Call} is to be
preferred.

It is possible to pass numeric vectors of storage mode @code{double} to
C as @code{float *} or Fortran as @code{REAL} by setting the attribute
@code{Csingle}, most conveniently by using the @R{} functions
@code{as.single}, @code{single} or @code{storage.mode}.  This is
intended only to be used to aid interfacing to existing C or Fortran
code.

Unless formal argument @code{NAOK} is true, all the other arguments are
checked for missing values @code{NA} and for the IEEE special values
@code{NaN}, @code{Inf} and @code{-Inf}, and the presence of any of these
generates an error.  If it is true, these values are passed unchecked.

Argument @code{DUP} can be used to suppress copying.  It is dangerous:
see the on-line help for arguments against its use.  It is not possible
to pass numeric vectors as @code{float *} or @code{REAL} if
@code{DUP=TRUE}.

Finally, argument @code{PACKAGE} confines the search for the symbol name
to a specific shared library (or use @code{"base"} for code compiled
into @R{}).  Its use is highly desirable, as there is no way to avoid
two package writers using the same symbol name, and such name clashes
are normally sufficient to cause @R{} to crash.

Note that the compiled code should not return anything except through
its arguments: C functions should be of type @code{void} and Fortran
subprograms should be subroutines.

To fix ideas, let us consider a very simple example which convolves two
finite sequences. (This is hard to do fast in interpreted @R{} code, but
easy in C code.)  We could do this using @code{.C} by

@example
void convolve(double *a, int *na, double *b, int *nb, double *ab)
@{
  int i, j, nab = *na + *nb - 1;

  for(i = 0; i < nab; i++)
    ab[i] = 0.0;
  for(i = 0; i < *na; i++)
    for(j = 0; j < *nb; j++)
      ab[i + j] += a[i] * b[j];
@}
@end example

@noindent
called from @R{} by

@example
conv <- function(a, b)
  .C("convolve",
     as.double(a),
     as.integer(length(a)),
     as.double(b),
     as.integer(length(b)),
     ab = double(length(a) + length(b) - 1))$ab
@end example

Note that we take care to coerce all the arguments to the correct @R{}
storage mode before calling @code{.C}; mistakes in matching the types
can lead to wrong results or hard-to-catch errors.


@node dyn.load and dyn.unload, Creating shared libraries, Interface functions .C and .Fortran, System and foreign language interfaces
@section @code{dyn.load} and @code{dyn.unload}
@cindex Dynamic loading

@findex dyn.load
@findex dyn.unload

Compiled code to be used with @R{} is loaded as a shared library (Unix,
@pxref{Creating shared libraries} for more information) or DLL
(Windows).

The library/DLL is loaded by @code{dyn.load} and unloaded by
@code{dyn.unload}.  Unloading is not normally necessary, but it is
needed to allow the DLL to be re-built on some platforms, including
Windows.

The first argument to both functions is a character string giving the
path to the library.  Programmers should not assume a specific file
extension for the library (such as @samp{.so}) but use a construction
like

@example
file.path(path1, path2, paste("mylib", .Platform$dynlib.ext, sep=""))
@end example

@noindent
for platform independence.  On Unix systems the path supplied to
@code{dyn.load} can be an absolute path, one relative to the current
directory or, if it starts with @samp{~}, relative to the user's home
directory.

Loading is most often done via a call to @code{library.dynam}
@findex library.dynam
in the @code{.First.lib} function of a package.  This has the form

@smallexample
library.dynam("libname", package, lib.loc)
@end smallexample

@noindent
where @code{libname} is the library/DLL name with the extension omitted.

Under some Unix systems there is a choice of how the symbols are
resolved when the library is loaded, governed by the arguments
@code{local} and @code{now}.  Only use these if really necessary: in
particular using @code{now=FALSE} and then calling an unresolved symbol
will terminate @R{} unceremoniously.

If a library/DLL is loaded more than once the most recent version is
used.  More generally, if the same symbol name appears in several
libraries, the most recently loaded occurrence is used.  The
@code{PACKAGE} argument provides a good way to avoid any ambiguity in
which occurrence is meant.

@node Creating shared libraries, Interfacing C++ code, dyn.load and dyn.unload, System and foreign language interfaces
@section Creating shared libraries
@cindex Creating shared libraries
@findex R CMD SHLIB

Under Unix, shared libraries for loading into @R{} can be created using
@code{R CMD SHLIB}.  This accepts as arguments a list of files which
must be object files (with extension @file{.o}) or C or Fortran sources
(with extensions @file{.c} and @file{.f}, respectively).  See @kbd{R CMD
SHLIB --help}, or the on-line help for @code{SHLIB}, for usage
information.  If compiling the source files does not work ``out of the
box'', you can specify additional flags by setting some of the variables
@code{PKG_CPPFLAGS} (for the C preprocessor, typically @samp{-I} flags),
@code{PKG_CFLAGS} and @code{PKG_FFLAGS} (for the C and Fortran
compilers, respectively) in the file @file{Makevars} in the compilation
directory, or write a @file{Makefile} in the compilation directory
containing the rules required (or, of course, create the object files
directly from the command line).  Similarly, variable @code{PKG_LIBS} in
@file{Makevars} can be used for additional @samp{-l} and @samp{-L} flags
to be passed to the linker when building the shared library.

If an add-on package @var{pkg} contains C or Fortran code in its
@file{src} subdirectory, @code{R CMD INSTALL} creates a shared library
(for loading into @R{} in the @code{.First.lib} function of the package)
either automatically using the above @code{R CMD SHLIB} mechanism, or
using @code{make} if a @file{src} contains a @file{Makefile}.  In both
cases, if file @file{Makevars} exists it is read first when invoking
@code{make}.  If a @file{Makefile} is really needed or provided, it
needs to ensure that the shared library created is linked against all
Fortran libraries that @R{} was linked against; @code{make} variable
@code{FLIBS} contains this information.

@node Interfacing C++ code, Handling R objects in C, Creating shared libraries, System and foreign language interfaces

Suppose we have the following hypothetical C++ library, consisting of

Y::Y()  @{ cout << "constructor Y" << endl; @}
Y::~Y() @{ cout << "destructor Y" << endl; @}
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

To use with @R{}, the only thing we have to do is writing a wrapper
function and ensuring that the function is enclosed in

@smallexample
extern "C" @{

@}
@end smallexample

For example,

@smallexample
@cartouche
// X_main.cc:

#include "X.hh"

extern "C" @{

void X_main () @{
  X x;
@}

@}
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

Compiling and linking should be done with the C++ compiler-linker
(rather than the C compiler-linker or the linker itself); otherwise,
the C++ initialization code (and hence the constructor of the static
variable @code{Y}) are not called.  For example, under Linux we might
use

@smallexample
g++ -c X.cc
g++ -c X_main.cc
g++ -shared -o X.so X_main.o X.o

@node Handling R objects in C, Interface functions .Call and .External, Interfacing C++ code, System and foreign language interfaces
@section Handling R objects in C
@cindex Handling R objects in C

Using C code to speed up the execution of an @R{} function is often very
fruitful.  Traditionally this has been done via the @code{.C} function
in @R{}.
@c (for details, see the @R{} documentation on @code{.C}).
One restriction of this interface is that the @R{} objects can not be
handled directly in C.  This becomes more troublesome when one wishes to
call @R{} functions from within the C code.  There is a C function
provided called @code{call_R} (also known as @code{call_S} for
compatibility with S) that can do that, but it is cumbersome to use, and
the mechanisms documented here are usually simpler to use, as well as
more powerful.

If a user really wants to write C code using internal @R{} data
structures, then that can be done using the @code{.Call} and
@code{.External} function.  The syntax for the calling function in @R{}
in each case is similar to that of @code{.C}, but the two functions have
rather different C interfaces.  Generally the @code{.Call} interface
(which is modelled on the interface of the same name in @Sl{} version 4)
is a little simpler to use, but @code{.External} is a little more
general.
@findex .Call
@findex .External

A call to @code{.Call} is very similar to @code{.C}, for example

@example
.Call("convolve2", a, b)
@end example

@noindent
The first argument should be a character string giving a C symbol name
of code that has already been loaded into @R{}.  Up to 65 @R{} objects
can passed as arguments.  The C side of the interface is

@example
#include <R.h>
#include <Rinternals.h>

SEXP convolve2(SEXP a, SEXP b)
 ...
@end example

A call to @code{.External} is almost identical

@example
.External("convolveE", a, b)
@end example

@noindent
but the C side of the interface is different, having only one argument

@example
#include <R.h>
#include <Rinternals.h>

SEXP convolveE(SEXP args)
 ...
@end example

@noindent
Here @code{args} is a @code{LISTSXP}, a Lisp-style list from which the
arguments can be extracted.

In each case the @R{} objects are available for manipulation via a set
of functions and macros defined in the header file @file{Rinternals.h}
or some higher-level macros defined in @file{Rdefines.h}.  Details on
@code{.Call} and @code{.External} are given further below.

Before you decide to use @code{.Call} or @code{.External}, you should
look at other alternatives.  First, consider working in interpreted @R{}
code; if this is fast enough, this is normally the best option.  You
should also see if using @code{.C} is enough.  If the task to be
performed in C is simple enough requiring no call to @R{}, @code{.C}
suffices.  The new interfaces are recent additions to @Sl{} and @R{},
and a great deal of useful code has been written using just @code{.C}
before they were available.  The @code{.Call} and @code{.External}
interfaces allow much more control, but they also impose much greater
responsibilities so need to be used with care.

There are two approaches that can be taken to handling @R{} objects from
within C code.  The first (historically) is to use the macros and
functions that have been used to implement the core parts of @R{}
through @code{.Internal} calls.  A public subset of these is defined in
the header file @file{Rinternals.h} in the directory
@file{$R_HOME/include} that should be available on any @R{}
installation.

A more recent approach is to use @R{} versions of the macros and
functions defined for the @Sl{} version 4 interface @code{.Call}, which
are defined in the header file @file{Rdefines.h}.  This is a somewhat
simpler approach, and is certainly to be preferred if the code might be
shared with @Sl{} at any stage.

A substantial amount of @R{} is implemented using the functions and
macros described here, so the @R{} source code provides a rich source of
examples and ``how to do it'': indeed many of the examples here were
developed by examining closely @R{} system functions for similar tasks.
Do make use of the source code for inspirational examples.

It is necessary to know something about how @R{} objects are handled in
C code.  All the @R{} objects you will deal with will be handled with
the type @dfn{SEXP}@footnote{SEXP is an acronym for @emph{S}imple
@emph{EXP}ression, common in LISP-like language syntaxes.}, which is a
pointer to a structure.  Think of this structure as a @emph{variant
type} that can handle all the usual types of @R{} objects, that is
vectors of various modes, functions, environments, language objects and
so on.  The details are given later in this section, but for most
purposes the programmer does not need to know them.  Think rather of a
model such as that used by Visual Basic, in which @R{} objects are
handed around in C code (as they are in interpreted @R{} code) as the
variant type, and the appropriate part is extracted for, for example,
numerical calculations, only when it is needed.  As in interpreted @R{}
code, much use is made of coercion to force the variant object to the
right type.

@subsection Handling the effects of garbage collection
@cindex Garbage collection

@findex PROTECT
@findex UNPROTECT

We need to know a little about the way @R{} handles memory allocation.
The memory allocated for @R{} objects is not freed by the user; instead,
the memory is from time to time @dfn{garbage collected}.  That is, all
the allocated memory not being used is freed, and the objects that are
in use may be moved.  If you create an @R{} object in your C code, you
must tell @R{} that you are using the object via call to the
@code{PROTECT} macro.  This has two effects.  First it tells @R{} that
the object is in use so it is not destroyed.  Second, it ensures that
the @code{SEXP} pointer to the object is updated if the object's
structure is moved in memory during garbage collection.  (Because of
this it is not safe to save and re-use pointers to parts of an object's
structure.)

Protecting a @code{SEXP} pointer protexts all the @R{} objects in a
recursive structure (such as list).

The programmer is solely responsible for housekeeping the calls to
@code{PROTECT}.  There is a corresponding macro @code{UNPROTECT} that
takes as argument an @code{int} giving the number of @code{SEXP}s to
unprotect when they are no longer needed.  The protection mechanism is
stack-based, so @code{UNPROTECT(@var{n})} unprotects the last @var{n}
objects which were protected.  The calls to @code{PROTECT} and
@code{UNPROTECT} must balance when the user's code returns, even if it
returns because of an error (calling @code{error} or @code{errorcall}
for example).  @R{} will warn about @code{"stack imbalance in .Call"}
(or @code{.External}) if the housekeeping is wrong.

Here is a small example of creating an @R{} numeric vector in C code.
First we use the macros in @file{Rdefines.h}:

@example
#include <R.h>
#include <Rdefines.h>

  SEXP ab;
    ....
  PROTECT(ab = NEW_NUMERIC(2));
  NUMERIC_POINTER(ab)[0] = 123.45;
  NUMERIC_POINTER(ab)[1] = 67.89;
  UNPROTECT(1);
@end example

@noindent
and then those in @file{Rinternals.h}:

@example
#include <R.h>
#include <Rinternals.h>

  SEXP ab;
    ....
  PROTECT(ab = allocVector(REALSXP, 2));
  REAL(ab)[0] = 123.45; REAL(ab)[1] = 67.89;
  UNPROTECT(1);
@end example

Now, the reader may ask how the @R{} object could possibly get removed
during those manipulations, as it is just our C code that is running.
The answer is we do not know (nor want to know) what is hiding behind
the @R{} macros and functions we use, and any of them might cause memory
to be allocated, hence garbage collection and hence our object @code{ab}
to be (re)moved.  It is wise to err on the side of caution and assume
that any of the @R{} macros and functions might (re)move the object.

Protection is not needed for objects which @R{} already knows are in
use.  In particular, this applies to function arguments.

There is a less-used@footnote{for historical reasons,
@code{UNPROTECT_PTR(@var{s})} has existed only since @R{} version 0.63.0
(Nov.@: 1998)} macro @code{UNPROTECT_PTR(@var{s})} that unprotects the
@code{SEXP} @var{s}.
@findex UNPROTECT_PTR

@node Allocating storage, Details of R types, Garbage Collection, Handling R objects in C
@subsection Allocating storage
@cindex Allocating storage

For many purposes it is sufficient to allocate @R{} objects and
manipulate those.  There are quite a few @code{alloc@var{Xxx}} functions
defined in @file{Rinternals.h}---you may want to explore them.  These
allocate @R{} objects of various types, and for the standard vector
types there are @code{NEW_@var{XXX}} macros defined in
@file{Rdefines.h}.

If storage is required for C objects during the calculations this is
best allocating by calling @code{R_alloc}; @pxref{Memory allocation}.
All of these memory allocation routines do their own error-checking, so
the programmer may assume that they will raise an error and not return
if the memory cannot be allocated.

@node Details of R types, Attributes, Allocating storage, Handling R objects in C
@subsection Details of R types
@cindex Details of R types

Users of the @file{Rinternals.h} macros will need to know how the @R{}
types are known internally: this is more or less completely hidden if
the @file{Rdefines.h} macros are used.

The different @R{} data types are represented in C by @dfn{SEXPTYPE}.
Some of these are familiar from @R{} and some are internal data types.
The usual @R{} object modes are given in the table.

@quotation
@multitable {SEXPTYPE} {numeric with storage mode integer integer}

@item SEXPTYPE @tab @R{} equivalent

@item @code{REALSXP}  @tab numeric with storage mode @code{double}
@item @code{INTSXP}   @tab integer
@item @code{CPLXSXP}  @tab complex
@item @code{LGLSXP}   @tab logical
@item @code{STRSXP}   @tab character
@item @code{VECSXP}   @tab list (generic vector)

@item @code{SYMSXP}   @tab name/symbol
@item @code{CLOSXP}   @tab function or function closure
@item @code{ENVSXP}   @tab environment

@end multitable
@end quotation

@noindent
Among the important internal @code{SEXPTYPE}s are @code{LANGSXP},
@code{CHARSXP} etc.

Unless you are very sure about the type of the arguments, the code
should check the data types.  Sometimes it may also be necessary to
check data types of objects created by evaluating an @R{} expression in
the C code.  You can use functions like @code{isReal}, @code{isInteger}
and @code{isString} to do type checking.  See the header file
@file{Rinternals.h} for definitions of other such functions.  All of
these take a @code{SEXP} as argument and return 1 or 0 to indicate
@var{TRUE} or @var{FALSE}.  Once again there are two ways to do this,
and @file{Rdefines.h} has macros such as @code{IS_NUMERIC}.

What happens if the @code{SEXP} is not of the correct type? Sometimes
you have no other option except to generate an error.  You can use the
function @code{error} for this.  It is usually better to coerce the
object to the correct type.  For example, if you find that an
@code{SEXP} is of the type @code{INTEGER}, but you need a @code{REAL}
object, you can change the type by using, equivalently,

@example
PROTECT(@var{newSexp} = coerceVector(@var{oldSexp}, REALSXP));
@end example

@noindent
or

@example
PROTECT(@var{newSexp} = AS_NUMERIC(@var{oldSexp}));
@end example

@noindent
Protection is needed as a new @emph{object} is created; the object
formerly pointed to by the @code{SEXP} is re-used is still protected but
now unused.

All the coercion functions do their own error-checking, and generate
@code{NA}s with a warning or stop with an error as appropriate.

So far we have only seen how to create and coerce @R{} objects from C
code, and how to extract the numeric data from numeric @R{} vectors.
These can suffice to take us a long way in interfacing @R{} objects to
numerical algorithms, but we may need to know a little more to create
useful return objects.

@node Attributes, Classes, Details of R types, Handling R objects in C
@subsection Attributes
@cindex Attributes

Many @R{} objects have attributes: some of the most useful are classes
and the @code{dim} and @code{dimnames} that mark objects as matrices or
arrays.  It can also be helpful to work with the @code{names} attribute
of vectors.

To illustrate this, let us write code to take the outer product of two
vectors (which @code{outer} and @code{%o%} already do).  As usual the
@R{} code is simple

@example
out <- function(x, y) .Call("out", as.double(x), as.double(y))
@end example

@noindent
where we expect @code{x} and @code{y} to be numeric vectors, possibly
with names.  This time we do the coercion in the calling @R{} code.

C code to do the computations is

@example
#include <R.h>
#include <Rinternals.h>

SEXP out(SEXP x, SEXP y)
@{
  int i, j, nx, ny;
  double tmp;
  SEXP ans;

  nx = length(x); ny = length(y);
  PROTECT(ans = allocMatrix(REALSXP, nx, ny));
  for(i = 0; i < nx; i++) @{
    tmp = REAL(x)[i];
    for(j = 0; j < ny; j++)
      REAL(ans)[i + nx*j] = tmp * REAL(y)[j];
  @}
  UNPROTECT(1);
  return(ans);
@}
@end example

@noindent
but we would like to set the @code{dimnames} of the result.  Although
@code{allocMatrix} provides a short cut, we will show how to set the
@code{dim} attribute directly.

@example
#include <R.h>
#include <Rinternals.h>

SEXP out(SEXP x, SEXP y)
@{
  int i, j, nx, ny;
  double tmp;
  SEXP ans, dim, dimnames;

  nx = length(x); ny = length(y);
  PROTECT(ans = allocVector(REALSXP, nx*ny));
  for(i = 0; i < nx; i++) @{
    tmp = REAL(x)[i];
    for(j = 0; j < ny; j++)
      REAL(ans)[i + nx*j] = tmp * REAL(y)[j];
  @}
  PROTECT(dim = allocVector(INTSXP, 2));
  INTEGER(dim)[0] = nx; INTEGER(dim)[1] = ny;
  setAttrib(ans, R_DimSymbol, dim);

  PROTECT(dimnames = allocVector(VECSXP, 2));
  VECTOR(dimnames)[0] = getAttrib(x, R_NamesSymbol);
  VECTOR(dimnames)[1] = getAttrib(y, R_NamesSymbol);
  setAttrib(ans, R_DimNamesSymbol, dimnames);
  UNPROTECT(3);
  return(ans);
@}
@end example

This example introduces several new features.  The @code{getAttrib} and
@code{setAttrib}
@findex getAttrib
@findex setAttrib
functions get and set individual attributes.  Their second argument is a
@code{SEXP} defining the name in the symbol table of the attribute we
want; these and many such symbols are defined in the header file
@file{Rinternals.h}.

There are shortcuts here too: the functions @code{namesgets},
@code{dimgets} and @code{dimnamesgets} are the internal versions of
@code{names<-}, @code{dim<-} and @code{dimnames<-}, and there are
functions such as @code{GetMatrixDimnames} and @code{GetArrayDimnames}.

What happens if we want to add an attribute that is not pre-defined? We
need to add a symbol for it @emph{via} a call to
@findex install
@code{install}.  Suppose for illustration we wanted to add an attribute
@code{"version"} with value @code{3.0}.  We could use

@example
  @{ SEXP version;
  PROTECT(version = allocVector(REALSXP, 1));
  REAL(version) = 3.0;
  setAttrib(ans, install("version"), version);
  UNPROTECT(1);
  @}
@end example

Using @code{install} when it is not needed is harmless and provides a
simple way to retrieve the symbol from the symbol table if it is already
installed.

@node Classes, Handling lists, Attributes, Handling R objects in C
@subsection Classes
@cindex Classes

In @R{} the class is just the attribute named @code{"class"} so it can
be handled as such, but there is a shortcut @code{classgets}.  Suppose
we want to give the return value in our example the class @code{"mat"}.
We can use

@example
#include <R.h>
#include <Rdefines.h>
    ....
  SEXP ans, dim, dimnames, class;
    ....
  PROTECT(class = allocVector(STRSXP, 1));
  STRING(class)[0] = COPY_TO_USER_STRING("mat");
  classgets(ans, class);
  UNPROTECT(4);
  return(ans);
@}
@end example

@noindent
As the value is a character vector, we have to know how to create that
from a C character array, which we do using the macro
@code{COPY_TO_USER_STRING} defined in @file{Rdefines.h}.

@node Handling lists, Finding and setting variables, Classes, Handling R objects in C
@subsection Handling lists
@cindex Handling lists

Some care is needed with lists, as @R{} has moved from using LISP-like
lists (now called ``pairlists'') to S-like generic vectors.  As a
result, the appropriate test for a object of mode @code{list} is
@code{isNewList}, and we need @code{allocVector(VECSXP, n}) and
@emph{not} @code{allocList(n)}.

List elements can be retrieved or set by direct access to the elements
of the generic vector.  Suppose we have a list object

@example
a <- list(f=1, g=2, h=3)
@end example

@noindent
Then we can access @code{a$g} as @code{a[[2]]} by

@example
  double g;
    ....
  g = REAL(VECTOR(a)[1])[0];
@end example

This can rapidly become tedious, and the following function (based on
one in package @pkg{nls}) is very useful:

@example
/* get the list element named str, or return NULL */

SEXP getListElement(SEXP list, char *str)
@{
  SEXP elmt = R_NilValue, names = getAttrib(list, R_NamesSymbol);
  int i;

  for (i = 0; i < length(list); i++)
    if(strcmp(CHAR(STRING(names)[i]), str) == 0) @{
      elmt = VECTOR(list)[i];
      break;
    @}
  return elmt;
@}
@end example

@noindent
and enables us to say

@example
  double g;
  g = REAL(getListElement(a, "g"))[0];
@end example

@node Finding and setting variables,  , Handling lists, Handling R objects in C
@subsection Finding and setting variables
@cindex Finding variables
@cindex Setting variables

It will be usual that all the @R{} objects needed in our C computations
are passed as arguments to @code{.Call} or @code{.External}, but it is
possible to find the values of @R{} objects from within the C given
their names.  The following code is the equivalent of @code{get(name,
envir = rho)}.

@example
SEXP getvar(SEXP name, SEXP rho)
@{
  SEXP ans;

  if(!isString(name) || length(name) != 1)
     error("name is not a single string");
  if(!isEnvironment(rho))
    error("rho should be an environment");
  ans = findVar(install(CHAR(STRING(name)[0])), rho);
  printf("first value is %f\n", REAL(ans)[0]);
  return(R_NilValue);
@}
@end example

The main work is done by
@findex findVar
@code{findVar}, but to use it we need to install @code{name} as a name
in the symbol table.  As we wanted the value for internal use, we return
@code{NULL}.

Similar functions with syntax

@example
void defineVar(SEXP symbol, SEXP value, SEXP rho)
void setVar(SEXP symbol, SEXP value, SEXP rho)
@end example
@findex defineVar
@findex setVar

@noindent
can be used to assign values to @R{} objects, in the specified
environment frame and to perform the equivalent of @code{assign(x,
value, envir = rho, inherits = TRUE)} respectively.

@section Interface functions @code{.Call} and @code{.External}
@cindex Interfaces to compiled code

In this section we consider the details of the @R{}/C interfaces.

These two interfaces have almost the same functionality. @code{.Call} is
based on the interface of the same name in @Sl{} version 4, and
@code{.External} is based on @code{.Internal}.  @code{.External} is more
complex but allows a variable number of arguments.

@subsection Calling @code{.Call}

@findex .Call

Let us convert our finite convolution example to use @code{.Call}, first
using the @file{Rdefines.h} macros.  The calling function in @R{} is

@example
conv <- function(a, b) .Call("convolve2", a, b)
@end example

@noindent
which could hardly be simpler, but as we shall see all the type checking
must be transferred to the C code, which is

@example
#include <R.h>
#include <Rdefines.h>

SEXP convolve2(SEXP a, SEXP b)
@{
  int i, j, na, nb, nab;
  double *xa, *xb, *xab;
  SEXP ab;

  PROTECT(a = AS_NUMERIC(a));
  PROTECT(b = AS_NUMERIC(b));
  na = LENGTH(a); nb = LENGTH(b); nab = na + nb - 1;
  PROTECT(ab = NEW_NUMERIC(nab));
  xa = NUMERIC_POINTER(a); xb = NUMERIC_POINTER(b);
  xab = NUMERIC_POINTER(ab);
  for(i = 0; i < nab; i++) xab[i] = 0.0;
  for(i = 0; i < na; i++)
    for(j = 0; j < nb; j++) xab[i + j] += xa[i] * xb[j];
  UNPROTECT(3);
  return(ab);
@}
@end example

Note that unlike the macros in @Sl{} version 4, the @R{} versions of
these macros do check that coercion can be done and raise an error if it
fails.  They will raise warnings if missing values are introduced by
coercion.  Although we illustrate doing the coercion in the C code here,
it often is simpler to do the necessary coercions in the @R{} code.

Now for the version in @R{}-internal style.  Only the C code changes.

@example
#include <R.h>
#include <Rinternals.h>
SEXP convolve2(SEXP a, SEXP b)
@{
  int i, j, na, nb, nab;
  double *xa, *xb, *xab;
  SEXP ab;

  PROTECT(a = coerceVector(a, REALSXP));
  PROTECT(b = coerceVector(b, REALSXP));
  na = length(a); nb = length(b); nab = na + nb - 1;
  PROTECT(ab = allocVector(REALSXP, nab));
  xa = REAL(a); xb = REAL(b);
  xab = REAL(ab);
  for(i = 0; i < nab; i++) xab[i] = 0.0;
  for(i = 0; i < na; i++)
    for(j = 0; j < nb; j++) xab[i + j] += xa[i] * xb[j];
  UNPROTECT(3);
  return(ab);
@}
@end example

@noindent
This is called in exactly the same way.

@node Calling .External, Missing and special values, Calling .Call, Interface functions .Call and .External
@subsection Calling @code{.External}

@findex .External

We can use the same example to illustrate @code{.External}.  The @R{}
code changes only by replacing @code{.Call} by @code{.External}

@example
conv <- function(a, b) .External("convolveE", a, b)
@end example

@noindent
but the main change is how the arguments are passed to the C code, this
time as a single SEXP.  The only change to the C code is how we handle
the arguments.

@example
#include <R.h>
#include <Rinternals.h>

SEXP convolveE(SEXP args)
@{
  int i, j, na, nb, nab;
  double *xa, *xb, *xab;
  SEXP a, b, ab;

  PROTECT(a = coerceVector(CADR(args), REALSXP)));
  PROTECT(b = coerceVector(CADDR(args), REALSXP)));
    ...
@}
@end example

@noindent
Once again we do not need to protect the arguments, as in the @R{} side
of the interface they are objects that are already in use.  The macros

@example
  first = CADR(args);
  second = CADDR(args);
  third = CADDDR(args);
  fourth = CAD4R(args);
@end example

@noindent
provide convenient ways to access the first four arguments.  More
generally we can use the
@findex CAR
@findex CDR
@code{CDR} and @code{CAR} macros as in

@example
  args = CDR(args); a = CAR(args);
  args = CDR(args); b = CAR(args);
@end example

@noindent
which clearly allows us to extract an unlimited number of arguments
(whereas @code{.Call} has a limit, albeit at 65 not a small one).

More usefully, the @code{.External} interface provides an easy way to
handle calls with a variable number of arguments, as @code{length(args)}
will give the number of arguments supplied (of which the first is
ignored).  We may need to know the names (`tags') given to the actual
arguments, which we can by using the @code{TAG} macro and using
something like the following example, that print the names and the first
value of its arguments if they are vector types.

@example
SEXP showArgs(SEXP args)
@{
  int i, nargs;
  Rcomplex cpl;
  char *name;

  if((nargs = length(args) - 1) > 0) @{
    for(i = 0; i < nargs; i++) @{
      args = CDR(args);
      name = CHAR(PRINTNAME(TAG(args)));
      switch(TYPEOF(CAR(args))) @{
      case REALSXP:
        printf("[%d] '%s' %f\n", i+1, name, REAL(CAR(args))[0]);
        break;
      case LGLSXP:
      case INTSXP:
        printf("[%d] '%s' %d\n", i+1, name, INTEGER(CAR(args))[0]);
        break;
      case CPLXSXP:
        cpl = COMPLEX(CAR(args))[0];
        printf("[%d] '%s' %f + %fi\n", i+1, name, cpl.r, cpl.i);
        break;
      case STRSXP:
        printf("[%d] '%s' %s\n", i+1, name,
               CHAR(STRING(CAR(args))[0]));
        break;
      default:
        printf("[%d] '%s' R type\n", i+1, name);
      @}
    @}
  @}
  return(R_NilValue);
@}
@end example

This can be called by the wrapper function

@example
showArgs <- function(...) .External("showArgs", ...)
@end example

@noindent
Note that this style of programming is convenient but not necessary, as
an alternative style is

@example
showArgs <- function(...) .Call("showArgs1", list(...))
@end example

@node Missing and special values,  , Calling .External, Interface functions .Call and .External
@subsection Missing and special values
@cindex Missing values
@cindex IEEE special values

One piece of error-checking the @code{.C} call does (unless @code{NAOK}
is true) is to check for missing (@code{NA}) and IEEE special values
(@code{Inf}, @code{-Inf} and @code{NaN}) and give an error if any are
found.  With the @code{.Call} interface these will be passed to our
code.  In this example the special values are no problem, as IEEE
arithmetic will handle them correctly.  In the current implementation
this is also true of @code{NA} as it is a type of @code{NaN}, but it is
unwise to rely on such details.  Thus we will re-write the code to
handle @code{NA}s using macros defined in @file{Arith.h} included by
@file{R.h}.

The code changes are the same in any of the versions of @code{convolve2}
or @code{convolveE}:

@example
    ...
  for(i = 0; i < na; i++)
    for(j = 0; j < nb; j++)
        if(ISNA(xa[i]) || ISNA(xb[j]) || ISNA(xab[i + j]))
          xab[i + j] = NA_REAL;
        else
          xab[i + j] += xa[i] * xb[j];
    ...
@end example

@findex ISNA
@findex ISNAN

Note that the @code{ISNA} macro, and the similar macros @code{ISNAN}
(which checks for @code{NaN} or @code{NA}) and @code{R_FINITE} (which is
false for @code{NA} and all the special values), only apply to numeric
values of type @code{double}.  Missingness of integers, logicals and
character strings can be tested by equality to the constants
@code{NA_INTEGER}, @code{NA_LOGICAL} and @code{NA_STRING}.  These and
@code{NA_REAL} can be used to set elements of @R{} vectors to @code{NA}.

The constants @code{R_NaN}, @code{R_PosInf}, @code{R_NegInf} and
@code{R_NaReal} can be used to set @code{double}s to the special values.

@node Evaluating R expressions from C, Debugging, Interface functions .Call and .External, System and foreign language interfaces
@section Evaluating R expressions from C
@cindex Evaluating R expressions from C

We noted that the @code{call_R} interface could be used to evaluate @R{}
expressions from C code, but the current interfaces are much more
convenient to use.  The main function we will use is

@example
SEXP eval(SEXP expr, SEXP rho);
@end example

@noindent
the equivalent of the interpreted @R{} code @code{eval(expr, envir =
rho)}, although we can also make use of @code{findVar}, @code{defineVar}
and @code{findFun} (which restricts the search to functions).

To see how this might be applied, here is a simplified internal version
of @code{lapply} for expressions, used as

@example
a <- list(a = 1:5, b = rnorm(10), test = runif(100))
.Call("lapply", a, quote(sum(x)), new.env())
@end example

@noindent
with C code

@example
SEXP lapply(SEXP list, SEXP expr, SEXP rho)
@{
  int i, n = length(list);
  SEXP ans;

  if(!isNewList(list)) error("`list' must be a list");
  if(!isEnvironment(rho)) error("`rho' should be an environment");
  PROTECT(ans = allocVector(VECSXP, n));
  for(i = 0; i < n; i++) @{
    defineVar(install("x"), VECTOR(list)[i], rho);
    VECTOR(ans)[i] = eval(expr, rho);
  @}
  setAttrib(ans, R_NamesSymbol, getAttrib(list, R_NamesSymbol));
  UNPROTECT(1);
  return(ans);
@}
@end example

It would be closer to @code{lapply} if we could pass in a function
rather than an expression.  One way to do this is @emph{via} interpreted
@R{} code as in the next example, but it is possible (if somewhat
obscure) to do this in C code.  The following is based on the code in
@file{src/main/optimize.c}.

@example
SEXP lapply2(SEXP list, SEXP fn, SEXP rho)
@{

@subsection Zero-finding
@cindex Zero-finding

In this section we re-work the example in @file{demos/dynload} of
@code{call_R} (based on that for @code{call_S} in Becker, Chambers &
Wilks (1988)) on finding a zero of a univariate function.  The @R{} code
and an example are

@example
zero <- function(f, guesses, tol = 1e-7) @{
  f.check <- function(x) @{
    x <- f(x)
    if(!is.numeric(x)) stop("Need a numeric result")
    as.double(x)
  @}
  .Call("zero", body(f.check), as.double(guesses), as.double(tol),
        new.env())
@}

cube1 <- function(x) (x^2 + 1) * (x - 1.5)
zero(cube1, c(0, 5))
@end example

@noindent
where this time we do the coercion and error-checking in the @R{} code.
The C code is

@example
SEXP mkans(double x)
@{
    SEXP ans;
    PROTECT(ans = allocVector(REALSXP, 1));
    REAL(ans)[0] = x;
    UNPROTECT(1);
    return ans;
@}

double feval(double x, SEXP f, SEXP rho)
@{
    defineVar(install("x"), mkans(x), rho);
    return(REAL(eval(f, rho))[0]);
@}

SEXP zero(SEXP f, SEXP guesses, SEXP stol, SEXP rho)
@{
    double x0 = REAL(guesses)[0], x1 = REAL(guesses)[1],
           tol = REAL(stol)[0];
    double f0, f1, fc, xc;
    SEXP res;

    if(tol <= 0.0) error("non-positive tol value");
    f0 = feval(x0, f, rho); f1 = feval(x1, f, rho);
    if(f0 == 0.0) return mkans(x0);
    if(f1 == 0.0) return mkans(x1);
    if(f0*f1 > 0.0) error("x[0] and x[1] have the same sign");
    for(;;) @{
        xc = 0.5*(x0+x1);
        if(fabs(x0-x1) < tol) return  mkans(xc);
        fc = feval(xc, f, rho);
        if(fc == 0) return  mkans(xc);
        if(f0*fc > 0.0) @{
            x0 = xc; f0 = fc;
        @} else @{
            x1 = xc; f1 = fc;
        @}
    @}
@}
@end example

@noindent
The C code is essentially unchanged from the @code{call_R} version, just
using a couple of functions to convert from @code{double} to @code{SEXP}
and to evaluate @code{f.check}.

@subsection Calculating numerical derivatives
@cindex Numerical derivatives

We will use a longer example (by Saikat DebRoy) to illustrate the use of
evaluation and @code{.External}.  This calculates numerical derivatives,
something that could be done as effectively in interpreted @R{} code but
may be needed as part of a larger C calculation.

An interpreted @R{} version and an example are

@example
numeric.deriv <- function(expr, theta, rho=sys.frame(sys.parent()))
@{
  eps <- sqrt(.Machine$double.eps)
  ans <- eval(substitute(expr), rho)
  grad <- matrix(,length(ans), length(theta),
                 dimnames=list(NULL, theta))
  for (i in seq(along=theta)) @{
    old <- get(theta[i], envir=rho)
    delta <- eps * min(1, abs(old))
    assign(theta[i], old+delta, envir=rho)
    ans1 <- eval(substitute(expr), rho)
    assign(theta[i], old, envir=rho)
    grad[, i] <- (ans1 - ans)/delta
  @}
  attr(ans, "gradient") <- grad
  ans
@}
omega <- 1:5; x <- 1; y <- 2
numeric.deriv(sin(omega*x*y), c("x", "y"))
@end example

@noindent
where @code{expr} is an expression, @code{theta} a character vector of
variable names and @code{rho} the environment to be used.

For the compiled version the call from @R{} will be

@example
.External("numeric_deriv", @var{expr}, @var{theta}, @var{rho})
@end example

@noindent
with example usage

@example
.External("numeric_deriv", quote(sin(omega*x*y)),
          c("x", "y"), .GlobalEnv)
@end example

@noindent
Note the need to quote the expression to stop it being evaluated.

Here is the complete C code which we will explain section by section.

@example
#include <R.h> /* for DOUBLE_EPS */
#include <Rinternals.h>

SEXP numeric_deriv(SEXP args)
@{
  SEXP theta, expr, rho, ans, ans1, gradient, par, dimnames;
  double tt, xx, delta, eps = sqrt(DOUBLE_EPS);
  int start, i, j;

  expr = CADR(args);
  if(!isString(theta = CADDR(args)))
    error("theta should be of type character");
  if(!isEnvironment(rho = CADDR(args)))
    error("rho should be an environment");

  PROTECT(ans = coerceVector(eval(expr, rho), REALSXP));
  PROTECT(gradient = allocMatrix(REALSXP, LENGTH(ans), LENGTH(theta)));

  for(i = 0, start = 0; i < LENGTH(theta); i++, start += LENGTH(ans)) @{
    PROTECT(par = findVar(install(CHAR(STRING(theta)[i])), rho));
    tt = REAL(par)[0];
    xx = fabs(tt);
    delta = (xx < 1) ? eps : xx*eps;
    REAL(par)[0] += delta;
    PROTECT(ans1 = coerceVector(eval(expr, rho), REALSXP));
    for(j = 0; j < LENGTH(ans); j++)
      REAL(gradient)[j + start] =
        (REAL(ans1)[j] - REAL(ans)[j])/delta;
    REAL(par)[0] = tt;
    UNPROTECT(2); /* par, ans1 */
  @}

  PROTECT(dimnames = allocVector(VECSXP, 2));
  VECTOR(dimnames)[1] = theta;
  dimnamesgets(gradient, dimnames);
  setAttrib(ans, install("gradient"), gradient);
  UNPROTECT(3); /* ans  gradient  dimnames */
  return ans;
@}
@end example

The code to handle the arguments is

@example
  expr = CADR(args);
  if(!isString(theta = CADDR(args)))
    error("theta should be of type character");
  if(!isEnvironment(rho = CADDR(args)))
    error("rho should be an environment");
@end example

@noindent
Note that we check for correct types of @code{theta} and @code{rho} but
do not check the type of @code{expr}.  That is because @code{eval} can
handle many types of @R{} objects other than @code{EXPRSXP}.  There is
no useful coercion we can do, so we stop with an error message if the
arguments are not of the correct mode.

The first step in the code is to evaluate the expression in the
environment @code{rho}, by

@example
  PROTECT(ans = coerceVector(eval(expr, rho), REALSXP));
@end example

@noindent
We then allocate space for the calculated derivative by

@example
  PROTECT(gradient = allocMatrix(REALSXP, LENGTH(ans), LENGTH(theta)));
@end example

@noindent
The first argument to @code{allocMatrix} gives the @code{SEXPTYPE} of
the matrix: here we want it to be @code{REALSXP}.  The other two
arguments are the numbers of rows and columns.

@example
  for(i = 0, start = 0; i < LENGTH(theta); i++, start += LENGTH(ans)) @{
    PROTECT(par = findVar(install(CHAR(STRING(theta)[i])), rho));
@end example

@noindent
Here, we are entering a for loop.  We loop through each of the
variables.  In the @code{for} loop, we first create a symbol
corresponding to the @code{i}'th element of the @code{STRSXP}
@code{theta}.  Here, @code{STRING(theta)[i]} accesses the @code{i}'th
element of the @code{STRSXP} @code{theta}.  Macro @code{CHAR()} extracts
the actual character representation of it: it returns a pointer.  We
then install the name and use @code{findVar} to find its value.

@example
    tt = REAL(par)[0];
    xx = fabs(tt);
    delta = (xx < 1) ? eps : xx*eps;
    REAL(par)[0] += delta;
    PROTECT(ans1 = coerceVector(eval(expr, rho), REALSXP));
@end example

@noindent
We first extract the real value of the parameter, then calculate delta,
the increment to be used for approximating the numerical derivative.
Then we change the value stored in @code{par} (in environment
@code{rho}) by @code{delta} and evaluate @code{expr} in environment
@code{rho} again.  Because we are directly dealing with original @R{}
memory locations here, @R{} does the evaluation for the changed
parameter value.

@example
    for(j = 0; j < LENGTH(ans); j++)
      REAL(gradient)[j + start] =
        (REAL(ans1)[j] - REAL(ans)[j])/delta;
    REAL(par)[0] = tt;
    UNPROTECT(2);
  @}
@end example

@noindent
Now, we compute the @code{i}'th column of the gradient matrix.  Note how
it is accessed: @R{} stores matrices by column (like Fortran).

@example
  PROTECT(dimnames = allocVector(VECSXP, 2));
  VECTOR(dimnames)[1] = theta;
  dimnamesgets(gradient, dimnames);
  setAttrib(ans, install("gradient"), gradient);
  UNPROTECT(3);
  return ans;
@}
@end example

@noindent
First we add column names to the gradient matrix.  This is done by
allocating a list (a @code{VECSXP}) whose first element, the row names,
is @code{NULL} (the default) and the second element, the column names,
is set as @code{theta}.  This list is then assigned as the attribute
having the symbol @code{R_DimNamesSymbol}.  Finally we set the gradient
matrix as the gradient attribute of @code{ans}, unprotect the remaining
protected locations and return the answer @code{ans}.

Sooner or later programmers will be faced with the need to debug
compiled code loaded into @R{}.  Some ``tricks'' are worth knowing.

@node Finding entry points, Inspecting R objects, Debugging, Debugging
@subsection Finding entry points in dynamically loaded code

Under most compilation environments, compiled code dynamically loaded
into @R{} cannot have breakpoints set within it until it is loaded.
To use a symbolic debugger on such dynamically loaded code under UNIX
use

@itemize @bullet
@item
Call the debugger on the R executable, for example by @kbd{R -d gdb}.
@item
Start @R{}.
@item
At the @R{} prompt, use @code{dyn.load} or @code{library} to load your
library.
@item
Send an interrupt signal.  This will put you back to the debugger
prompt.
@item
Set the breakpoints in your code.
@item
Continue execution of R by typing @kbd{signal 0@key{RET}}.
@end itemize

Under Windows the @R{} engine is itself in a DLL, and the procedure is

@itemize @bullet
@item
Start @R{} under the debugger after setting a breakpoint for
@code{WinMain}.

@example
gdb .../bin/Rgui.exe
(gdb) break WinMain
(gdb) run
[ stops with R.dll loaded ]
(gdb) break R_ReadConsole
(gdb) continue
[ stops with console running ]
(gdb) continue
@end example

@item
At the @R{} prompt, use @code{dyn.load} or @code{library} to load your library.
@item
Set the breakpoints in your code.
@item
Use

@example
(gdb) clear R_ReadConsole
(gdb) continue
@end example

@noindent
to continue running with the breakpoints set.
@end itemize

@noindent
Windows has little support for signals, so the usual idea of running a
program under a debugger and sending it a signal to interrupt it and
drop control back to the debugger only works with some debuggers.

@node Inspecting R objects,  , Finding entry points, Debugging
@subsection Inspecting R objects when debugging
@cindex Inspecting R objects when debugging

The key to inspecting @R{} objects from compiled code is the function
@code{PrintValue(SEXP s)} which uses the normal @R{} printing mechanisms
to print the @R{} object pointed to by @code{s}, or the safer version
@code{R_PV(SEXP s)} which will only print `objects'.

One way to make use to @code{PrintValue} is to insert suitable calls
into the code to be debugged.

Another way is to call @code{R_PV} from the symbolic
debugger.  (@code{PrintValue} is hidden as @code{Rf_PrintValue}.)  For
example, from @code{gdb} we can use

@example
(gdb) p R_PV(ab)
@end example

@noindent
using the object @code{ab} from the convolution example, if we have
placed a suitable breakpoint in the convolution C code.

To examine an arbitrary @R{} object we need to work a little harder.
For example, let

@smallexample
R> DF <- data.frame(a = 1:3, b = 4:6)
@end smallexample

@noindent
By setting a breakpoint at @code{do_get} and typing @kbd{get("DF")} at
the R prompt, one can find out the address in memory of @code{DF}, for example

@smallexample
Value returned is $1 = (SEXPREC *) 0x40583e1c
(gdb) p *$1
$2 = @{
  sxpinfo = @{type = 19, obj = 1, named = 1, gp = 0,
    mark = 0, debug = 0, trace = 0, = 0@},
  attrib = 0x40583e80,
  u = @{
    vecsxp = @{
      length = 2,
      type = @{c = 0x40634700 "0>X@@D>X@@0>X@@", i = 0x40634700,
        f = 0x40634700, z = 0x40634700, s = 0x40634700@},
      truelength = 1075851272,
    @},
    primsxp = @{offset = 2@},
    symsxp = @{pname = 0x2, value = 0x40634700, internal = 0x40203008@},
    listsxp = @{carval = 0x2, cdrval = 0x40634700, tagval = 0x40203008@},
    envsxp = @{frame = 0x2, enclos = 0x40634700@},
    closxp = @{formals = 0x2, body = 0x40634700, env = 0x40203008@},
    promsxp = @{value = 0x2, expr = 0x40634700, env = 0x40203008@}
  @}
@}
@end smallexample

@noindent
(Debugger output reformatted for better legibility).

Using @code{R_PV()} one can ``inspect'' the values of the various
elements of the SEXP, for example,

@smallexample
(gdb) p R_PV($1->attrib)
$names
[1] "a" "b"

$row.names
[1] "1" "2" "3"

$class
[1] "data.frame"

$3 = void
@end smallexample


To find out where exactly the corresponding information is stored, one
needs to go ``deeper'':

@smallexample
(gdb) set $a = $1->attrib
(gdb) p $a->u.listsxp.tagval->u.symsxp.pname->u.vecsxp.type.c
$4 = 0x405d40e8 "names"
(gdb) p $a->u.listsxp.carval->u.vecsxp.type.s[1]->u.vecsxp.type.c
$5 = 0x40634378 "b"
(gdb) p $1->u.vecsxp.type.s[0]->u.vecsxp.type.i[0]
$6 = 1
(gdb) p $1->u.vecsxp.type.s[1]->u.vecsxp.type.i[1]
$7 = 5

There are a large number of entry points in the @R{} executable/DLL that
can be called from C code (and some that can be called from Fortran
code).  Only those documented here are stable enough that they will only
be changed with considerable notice.

The recommended procedure to use these is to include the header file
@file{R.h} in your C code by

@example
#include <R.h>
@end example

@noindent
This will include a number of other header files from the directory
@file{R_HOME/include/R_ext}, and there are other header files there that
can be included too, but many of the features they contain should be
regarded as undocumented and unstable.

An alternative is to include the header file @file{S.h}, which may be
useful when porting code from @Sl{}.  This includes rather less than
@file{R.h}, and has some compatibility definitions (for example the
@code{S_complex} type from @Sl{}).

@quotation
@strong{NOTE:} Because @R{} re-maps many of its external names to avoid
clashes with user code, it is @emph{essential} to include the
appropriate header files when using these entry points.

@node Memory allocation, Error handling, The R API, The R API
@section Memory allocation
@cindex Memory allocation from C

@menu
* Transient::
* User-controlled::
@end menu

There are two types of memory allocation available to the C programmer,
one in which @R{} manages the clean-up and the other in which user
has full control (and responsibility).

@node Transient, User-controlled, Memory allocation, Memory allocation
@subsection Transient storage allocation
@findex R_alloc
@findex S_alloc
@findex S_realloc
@findex vmaxget
@findex vmaxset

Here @R{} will reclaim the memory at the end of the call to @code{.C}.
Use

@example
char* R_alloc(long @var{n}, int @var{size})
@end example

@noindent
which allocates @var{n} units of @var{size} bytes each.  A typical usage
(from package @pkg{mva}) is

@example
x = (int *) R_alloc(nrows(merge)+2, sizeof(int));
@end example

There is a similar call, @code{S_alloc}, for compatibility with @Sl{}
which differs only in zeroing the memory allocated, and

@example
S_realloc(char *@var{p}, long @var{new}, long @var{old}, int @var{size})
@end example

@noindent
which changes the allocation size from @var{old} to @var{new} units, and
zeroes the additional units.

This memory is taken from the heap (the region whose size is set by
@code{--vsize}), and released at the end of the @code{.C}, @code{.Call}
or @code{.External} call.  Users can also manage it, by noting the
current position with a call to @code{vmaxget} and clearing memory
allocated subsequently by a call to @code{vmaxset}.  This is only
recommended for experts.

@node User-controlled,  , Transient, Memory allocation
@subsection User-controlled memory
@findex Calloc
@findex Realloc
@findex Free

The other form of memory allocation is an interface to @code{malloc},
the interface providing @R{} error handling.  This memory lasts until
freed by the user and is additional to the memory allocated for the @R{}
workspace.

The interface functions are

@example
@var{type}* Calloc(size_t @var{n}, @var{type})
@var{type}* Realloc(@var{any} *@var{p}, size_t @var{n}, @var{type})
void Free(@var{any} *@var{p})
@end example

@noindent
providing analogues of @code{calloc}, @code{realloc} and @code{free}.
If there is an error it is handled by @R{}, so if these routines return
the memory has been successfully allocated or freed.  @code{Free} will
set the pointer @code{p} to @code{NULL}.  (Some but not all versions of
@Sl{} do so.)

@node Error handling, Random numbers, Memory allocation, The R API
@section Error handling
@cindex Error handling from C

The basic error handling routines are the equivalents of @code{stop} and
@code{warning} in @R{} code, and use the same interface.

@example
void error(const char * @var{format}, ...);
void warning(const char * @var{format}, ...);
@end example

@noindent
These have the same call sequences as calls to @code{printf}, but in the
simplest case can be called with a single character string
argument giving the error message.

There is also an @Sl{}-compatibility interface which uses calls of the
form

@example
PROBLEM ...... ERROR
MESSAGE ...... WARN
PROBLEM ...... RECOVER(NULL_ENTRY)
MESSAGE ...... WARNING(NULL_ENTRY)
@end example

@noindent
the last two being the forms available in all @Sl{} versions.  Here
@code{......} is a set of arguments to @code{printf}, so can be a string
or a format string followed by arguments separated by commas.


@node Random numbers, Missing and IEEE values, Error handling, The R API
@section Random number generation
@cindex Random numbers in C
@findex unif_rand
@findex norm_rand
@findex exp_rand
@findex GetRNGstate
@findex PutRNGstate
@findex .Random.seed
@findex seed_in
@findex seed_out

The interface to @R{}'s internal random number generation routines is

@example
double unif_rand();
double norm_rand();
double exp_rand();
@end example

@noindent
giving one uniform, normal or exponential pseudo-random variate.
However, before these are used, the user must call

@example
GetRNGstate();
@end example

@noindent
and after all the required variates have been generated, call

@example
PutRNGstate();
@end example

@noindent
These essentially read in (or create) @code{.Random.seed} and write it
out after use.

File @file{S.h} defines @code{seed_in} and @code{seed_out} for
@Sl{}-compatibility rather than @code{GetRNGstate} and
@code{PutRNGstate}.  These take a @code{long *} argument which is
ignored.

The random number generator is private to @R{}; there is no way to
select the kind of RNG or set the seed except by evaluating calls to the
@R{} functions.

The C code behind @R{}'s @code{r@var{xxx}} functions can be accessed by
including the header file @file{R_ext/Mathlib.h}; @xref{Distribution
functions}.  Those calls generate a single variate and should also be
enclosed in calls to @code{GetRNGstate} and @code{PutRNGstate}.


@node Missing and IEEE values, Printing, Random numbers, The R API
@section Missing and IEEE special values
@cindex Missing values

@findex ISNA
@findex ISNAN
@findex R_FINITE
@findex R_IsNaN
@findex R_PosInf
@findex R_NegInf
@findex NA_REAL

It is possible to compile @R{} on a platform without IEEE 754-compatible
arithmetic, so users should not assume that it is available.  Rather a
set of functions is provided to test for @code{NA}, @code{Inf},
@code{-Inf} (which exists on all platforms) and @code{NaN}.  These
functions are accessed via macros:

@example
ISNA(@var{x})        @r{True for R's @code{NA} only}
ISNAN(@var{x})       @r{True for R's @code{NA} and IEEE @code{NaN}}
R_FINITE(@var{x})    @r{False for @code{Inf}, @code{-Inf}, @code{NA}, @code{NaN}}
@end example

@noindent
and function @code{R_IsNaN} is true for @code{NaN} but not @code{NA}.
Do use these rather than @code{isnan} or @code{finite}; the latter in
particular is often mendacious.

You can check for @code{Inf} or @code{-Inf} by testing equality to
@code{R_PosInf} or @code{R_NegInf}, and set (but not test) an @code{NA}
as @code{NA_REAL}.

All of the above apply to @emph{double} variables only.  For integer
variables there is a variable accessed by the macro @code{NA_INTEGER}
which can used to set or test for missingness.

Beware that these special values may be represented by extreme values
which could occur in ordinary computations which run out of control,
so you may need to test that they have not been generated inadvertently.


@node Printing, Calling C from Fortran, Missing and IEEE values, The R API
@section Printing
@cindex Printing from C
@findex Rprintf
@findex REprintf
@findex Rvprintf
@findex REvprintf

The most useful function for printing from a C routine compiled into
@R{} is @code{Rprintf}.  This is used in exactly the same way as
@code{printf}, but is guaranteed to write to @R{}'s output (which might
be a GUI console rather than a file).  It is wise to write complete
lines (including the @code{"\n"}) before returning to @R{}.

The function @code{REprintf} is similar but writes on the error stream
(@code{stderr}) which may or may not be different from the standard
output stream.  Functions @code{Rvprintf} and @code{REvprintf} are the
analogues using the @code{vprintf} interface.

@subsection Printing from Fortran
@cindex Printing from C

In theory Fortran @code{write} and @code{print} statements can be used,
but the output may not interleave well with that of C, and will be
invisible on GUI interfaces.  They are best avoided.

Three subroutines are provided to ease the output of information from
Fortran code.

@example
subroutine dblepr(@var{label}, @var{nchar}, @var{data}, @var{ndata})
subroutine realpr(@var{label}, @var{nchar}, @var{data}, @var{ndata})
subroutine intpr (@var{label}, @var{nchar}, @var{data}, @var{ndata})
@end example

@noindent
Here @var{label} is a character label of up to 255 characters,
@var{nchar} is its length (which can be @code{-1} if the whole label is
to be used), and @var{data} is an array of length at least @var{ndata}
of the appropriate type (@code{double precision}, @code{real} and
@code{integer} respectively).  These routines print the label on one
line and then print @var{data} as if it were an @R{} vector on
subsequent line(s).  They work with zero @var{ndata}, and so can be used
to print a label alone.

Naming conventions for symbols generated by Fortran differ by platform:
it is not safe to assume that Fortran names appear to C with a trailing
underscore.  To help cover up the platform-specific differences there is
a set of macros that should be used.

@section Numerical analysis subroutines
@cindex Numerical analysis subroutines from C

@R{} contains a large number of mathematical functions for its own use,
for example numerical linear algebra computations and special functions.

The header file @file{R_ext/Linpack.h} contains details of the LINPACK
and EISPACK linear algebra functions include in @R{}.  These are
expressed as calls to Fortran subroutines, and they will also be usable
from users' Fortran code.  Although not part of the official API, this
set of subroutines is unlikely to change (but might be supplemented).

The header file @file{R_ext/Mathlib.h} lists other undocumented calls
that are currently available, mainly special functions (such gamma, beta
and Bessel functions).  These @emph{are} subject to change.

@node Distribution functions, Mathematical Utilities, Numerical analysis subroutines, The R API
@section Distribution functions
@cindex  Distribution functions from C

The routines used to calculate densities, cumulative distribution
functions and quantile functions for the standard statistical
distributions are available as entry points.

The arguments for the entry points follow the pattern of those for the
normal distribution:

@example
double dnorm(double @var{x}, double @var{mu}, double @var{sigma}, int @var{give_log});
double pnorm(double @var{x}, double @var{mu}, double @var{sigma}, int @var{lower_tail},
             int @var{give_log});
double qnorm(double @var{p}, double @var{mu}, double @var{sigma}, int @var{lower_tail},
             int @var{log_p});
double rnorm(double @var{mu}, double @var{sigma});
@end example

@noindent
That is, the first argument gives the position for the density and CDF
and probability for the quantile function, followed by the
distribution's parameters.  Argument @var{lower_tail} should be @code{1}
(or @code{LTRUE}) for normal use, but can be @code{0} (or @code{LFALSE})
if the probability of the upper tail is desired or specified.

Note that you directly get the cumulative (or ``integrated'')
@emph{hazard} function, @eqn{H(t) = - \log(1 - F(t)), H(t) = - log(1 -
F(t))}, by using

@example
- p@var{dist}(t, ..., /*lower_tail = */ LFALSE, /* give_log = */ LTRUE)
@end example

@noindent
or shorter (and more cryptic) @code{- p@var{dist}(t, ..., 0, 1)}.
@cindex cumulative hazard

Finally, @var{give_log} should be non-zero if the result is required on
log scale, and @var{log_p} should be non-zero if @var{p} has been
specified on log scale.

The random-variate generation routine @code{rnorm} returns one normal
variate. @xref{Random numbers}, for the protocol in using the
random-variate routines.
@cindex Random numbers in C

Note that these argument sequences are (apart from the names and that
@code{rnorm} has no @var{n}) exactly the same as the corresponding @R{}
functions of the same name, so the documentation of the @R{} functions
can be used.

For reference, the following table gives the basic name (to be prefixed
by @samp{d}, @samp{p}, @samp{q} or @samp{r} apart from the exceptions
noted) and distribution-specific arguments for the complete set of
distributions.

The header files define @code{USING_R}, which should be used to test if
the code is indeed being used with @R{}.

Header file @file{Rversion.h} (included by @file{R.h}) defines a macro
@code{R_VERSION} giving the version number encoded as an integer, plus a
macro @code{R_Version} to do the encoding.  This can be used to test if
the version of @R{} is late enough, or to include back-compatibility
features.  For protection against earlier versions of @R{} which did not
have this macro, use a construction such as

@example
#if defined(R_VERSION) && R_VERSION >= R_Version(0, 99, 0)
  ...
#endif
@end example

More detailed information is available in the macros @code{R_MAJOR},
@code{R_MINOR}, @code{R_YEAR}, @code{R_MONTH} and @code{R_DAY}: see the

@node .Internal and .Primitive, Testing R code, R (internal) programming miscellania, R (internal) programming miscellania
@section @code{.Internal} and @code{.Primitive}

@findex .Internal
@findex .Primitive

C code compiled into @R{} at build time can be called ``directly'' or
via the @code{.Internal} interface, which is very similar to the
@code{.External} interface except in syntax.  More precisely, @R{}
maintains a table of R function names and corresponding C functions to
call, which by convention all start with @samp{do_} and return a SEXP.
Via this table (@code{R_FunTab} in file @file{src/main/names.c}) one can
also specify how many arguments to a function are required or allowed,
whether the arguments are to be evaluated before calling or not, and
whether the function is ``internal'' in the sense that it must be
accessed via the @code{.Internal} interface, or directly accessible in
which case it is printed in @R{} as @code{.Primitive}.

@R{}'s functionality can also be extended by providing corresponding C
code and adding to this function table.

In general, all such functions use @code{.Internal()} as this is safer
and in particular allows for transparent handling of named and default
arguments.  For example, @code{axis} is defined as

@example
axis <- function(side, at = NULL, labels = NULL, ...)
    .Internal(axis(side, at, labels, ...))
@end example

However, for reasons of convenience and also efficiency (as there is
some overhead in using the @code{.Internal} interface), there are
exceptions which can be accessed directly.  Note that these functions
make no use of @R{} code, and hence are very different from the usual
interpreted functions.  In particular, @code{args} and @code{body}
return @code{NULL} for such objects.

These ``primitive'' functions are fully specified as follows.

@enumerate

@item
``Special functions'' which really are @emph{language} elements, however
exist as ``primitive'' functions in @R{}:

@example
@{       (         if       for  while  repeat  break  next
return  function  on.exit
@end example

@item
Basic @emph{operator}s (i.e., functions usually @emph{not} called as
@code{foo(a, b, ...)}) for subsetting, assignment, arithmetic and logic.
These are the following 1-, 2-, and @math{N}-argument functions:

@example
          [    [[    $
<-   <<-  [<-  [[<-  $<-
---------------------------------------
+    -    *    /     ^    %%   %*%  %/%
<    <=   ==   !=    >=   >
|    ||   &    &&    !
@end example

@item
``Low level'' 0- and 1-argument functions which belong to one of the
following groups of functions:

@enumerate a
@item
Basic mathematical functions with a single argument, i.e.,

@example
sign    abs
floor   ceiling
----------------------
sqrt    exp
cos     sin      tan
acos    asin     atan
cosh    sinh     tanh
acosh   asinh    atanh
----------------------
cumsum  cumprod
cummax  cummin
----------------------
Im      Re
Arg     Conj     Mod
@end example

@noindent Note however that the @R{} function @code{log} has an optional
named argument @code{base}, and therefore is defined as

@example
log <- function(x, base = exp(1)) @{
  if(missing(base))
    .Internal(log(x))
  else
    .Internal(log(x, base))
@}
@end example

@noindent in order to ensure that @code{log(x = pi, base = 2)} is
identical to @code{log(base = 2, x = pi)}.

@item
Functions rarely used outside of ``programming'' (i.e., mostly used
inside other functions), such as

@example
nargs        missing
interactive  is.@emph{xxx}
.Primitive   .Internal   .External
symbol.C     symbol.For
globalenv    pos.to.env  unclass
@end example

@noindent
(where @emph{xxx} stands for almost 30 different notions, such as
@code{function}, @code{vector}, @code{numeric}, and so forth).

@item
The programming and session management utilities

@example
debug    undebug    trace  untrace
browser  proc.time
@end example

@end enumerate

@item
The following basic assignment and extractor functions

@example
.Alias      environment<-
length      length<-
class       class<-
attr        attr<-
attributes  attributes<-
dim         dim<-
dimnames    dimnames<-
@end example

@item
The following few @math{N}-argument functions are ``primitive'' for
efficiency reasons.  Care is taken in order to treat named arguments
properly:

@example
:          ~          c           list        unlist
call       as.call    expression  substitute
UseMethod  invisible
.C         .Fortran   .Call
@end example
