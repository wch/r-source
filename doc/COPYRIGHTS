COPYRIGHT STATUS

The bulk of this code is copyright by members of or all of the R Core
Team.  ('The R Core Team' in copyright statements in individual files
refers to some or all of the team.)

See the file COPYING for the exact conditions under which you may
redistribute it.  R as a whole is distributed under GPL version 2 or
3: most source files contain a copyright statement allowing use of
that file under GPL version 2 or later: the main exceptions are the
included versions of packages 'MASS', 'class', 'nnet', 'rpart' and
'spatial' (GPL-2 or GPL-3).  (The auxiliary file m4/openmp.m4 is under
GPL-3, but its incorporation into 'configure' is not.)

The status of files used only in the Windows port is in file
src/gnuwin32/COPYRIGHTS.win, which is appended to this file in binary
Windows distributions.

Note that almost all the code *is* copyright and may only be
reproduced if the copyright notice (that in the file or this notice)
is preserved.  The status of the included LINPACK routines is unclear:
they are said to be in the public domain in the USA.

	---------------------------------------------------

Some (but not all) of the public header files are distributed under
the more permissive terms of version 2.1 or later of the LGPL: see
files R_HOME/share/licenses/LGPL-2.1 and R_HOME/share/licenses/LGPL-3.
This applies only to the header files

src/include/R.h
src/include/Rdefines.h
src/include/Rgraphics.h
src/include/Rinternals.h
src/include/Rmath.h
src/include/S.h
src/include/R_ext/*.h

Note that it does not apply to the header files such as Rembedded.h
and Rinterface.h used for third-party front ends.

From the announcement of the change (2001-Feb-05)

    It came to our attention that some projects are interpreting GPL to
    mean that compiling against the header files or linking against a
    Windows import library brings the compiled code under the scope of
    GPL.  This would mean it would be impossible to distribute binary
    versions of non-GPL packages with compiled code which called entry
    points in the R executable or DLL, of which there are many on CRAN.

    We encourage packages to be distributed under Open Source conditions,
    but accept that this is not possible for some contributions.  Our
    intention is that export files and import libraries be 'accessors'
    under clause 5 of the LGPL, so that in most cases no (additional)
    restrictions are imposed by compiling a package using the LGPL-ed
    components of R.

    To avoid any anomalies, the versions of the same files in R versions
    1.0.0 to 1.2.1 may also be used under LGPL or GPL.

Import libraries are no longer used under Windows.

Some contributed files are also covered by the Library General Public License.
These include (see also below)

src/library/stats/R/embed.R
